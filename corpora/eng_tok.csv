0,the story of king frost,jan lawa lete

1,andrew lang,jan mali

2,there was once upon a time a peasantwoman who had a daughter and a stepdaughter,meli ike pi mani ala li jo e meli lili tu

3,the daughter had her own way in everything,ona li pana e ijo mute tawa meli lili ona

4,and whatever she did was right in her mother’s eyes but the poor stepdaughter had a hard time let her do what she would she was always blamed,taso ona li pana e ike taso tawa meli lili pi jan ante ona li pilin e ni meli ona li pona

5,and got small thanks for all the trouble she took,

6,nothing was right everything wrong,meli pi jan ante li ike li pali e ike ale

7,and yet if the truth were known the girl was worth her weight in goldshe was so unselfish and goodhearted,

8,but her stepmother did not like her and the poor girl’s days were spent in weeping,tenpo mute la meli lili pi jan ante li ike pilin oko ona li telo li loje

9,for it was impossible to live peacefully with the woman,

10,the wicked shrew was determined to get rid of the girl by fair means or foul,mama meli li ike kin

11,and kept saying to her father,mama meli li toki e ni tawa mama mije pi meli lili

12,send her away old man send her away,jan pi sin ala o weka e ona

13,anywhere so that my eyes sha’n’t be plagued any longer by the sight of her,mi wile ala lukin e ona

14,or my ears tormented by the sound of her voice,li wile ala kute e toki ona

15,send her out into the fields,o weka e ona tan tomo ni

16,and let the cutting frost do for her,

17,in vain did the poor old father weep and implore her pity,mama mije li wile awen e meli lili ona

18,she was firm,taso meli ike li wile wawa weka e ona

19,and he dared not gainsay her,mije li ken ala toki utala tawa meli ona la

20,so he placed his daughter in a sledge not even daring to give her a horsecloth to keep herself warm with and drove her out on to the bare open fields where he kissed her and left her driving home as fast as he could that he might not witness her miserable death,ona li pana e meli lili ona tawa poki tawa li tawa ma suli mije li weka e meli lili ona lon ni li pana ala e len seli tawa ona ona li uta lili e meli lili ona li tawa weka oko ona li telo taso ona li lukin monsi ala

21,deserted by her father the poor girl sat down under a firtree at the edge of the forest and began to weep silently,meli lili li tawa selo pi ma kasi li anpa lon poka kasi li telo tan oko

22,suddenly she heard a faint sound,ona li lukin sewi tan kalama

23,it was king frost,ona li lukin e jan lawa lete

24,springing from tree to tree,jan lawa lete li tawa sewi pi kasi wan li tawa sewi pi kasi ante

25,and cracking his fingers as he went,

26,at length he reached the firtree beneath which she was sitting,ona li lon kasi pi meli lili la

27,and with a crisp crackling sound he alighted beside her and looked at her lovely face,ona li anpa ona li kama e lete lon sinpin pi meli lili li toki e ni

28,well maiden he snapped out do you know who i am,sina sona ala sona e mi

29,i am king frost king of the rednoses,mi jan lawa lete

30,all hail to you great king answered the girl,meli lili li toki e ni jan lawa wawa o sina pona

31,in a gentle trembling voice,uta ona li lupa lukin

32,have you come to take me,sina tawa ala tawa e mi

33,are you warm maiden he replied,jan lawa lete li toki e ni meli pona o sina seli ala seli

34,quite warm king frost she answered,meli lili li toki e ni seli jan lawa lete o mi seli mute

35,though she shivered as she spoke,taso selo ona li tawa lili

36,then king frost stooped down and bent over the girl and the crackling sound grew louder,jan lawa lete li kama e lete lon poka ona

37,and the air seemed to be full of knives and darts,kon li lete mute

38,and again he asked,ona li toki sin e ni

39,maiden are you warm are you warm you beautiful girl,meli pona o sina seli ala seli

40,and though her breath was almost frozen on her lips,uta pi meli lili li ken ala tawa suli

41,she whispered gently quite warm king frost,ona li toki e ni jan lawa lete o mi seli

42,then king frost gnashed his teeth and cracked his fingers and his eyes sparkled and the crackling crisp sound was louder than ever,jan lawa lete li kama e lete suli wawa kon li lete mute kin oko ona li suno musi

43,and for the last time he asked her,ona li toki e ni

44,maiden are you still warm,meli pona o sina seli ala seli

45,are you still warm little love,tenpo ni la sina awen ala awen seli

46,and the poor girl was so stiff and numb,meli lili li ken ala toki mute tan lete

47,that she could just gasp,taso ona li kama jo e kon lili li toki e ni

48,still warm o king,jan lawa lete o mi awen seli

49,now her gentle courteous words and her uncomplaining ways touched king frost,meli lili li awen pona li toki utala ala

50,and he had pity on her,tan ni la jan lawa lete li pana e pona tawa ona

51,and he wrapped her up in furs and covered her with blankets and he fetched a great box in which were beautiful jewels and a rich robe embroidered in gold and silver and she put it on and looked more lovely than ever and king frost stepped with her into his sledge with six white horses,ona li len e meli lili kepeken len mani suli pi kiwen walo en kiwen jelo meli lili li suno mute li pona lukin jan lawa lete li pana e ona tawa poki tawa ona li pana e len seli soweli tawa ona soweli suli luka wan li tawa e poki tawa ona kepeken tenpo lili

52,in the meantime the wicked stepmother was waiting at home for news of the girl’s death,mama meli ike li lon tomo

53,and preparing pancakes,li pali e moku sike

54,for the funeral feast,ona li weka e sijelo pi meli lili la ona li wile jo e moku mute

55,and she said to her husband,ona li toki e ni tawa mije ona

56,old man you had better go out into the fields,o tawa ma suli

57,and find your daughter’s body and bury her,o kama jo e sijelo pi meli lili sina

58,just as the old man was leaving the house,mije li kama tawa

59,the little dog under the table began to bark saying,taso soweli pi lon anpa supa li mu e ni tawa ona

60,your daughter shall live to be your delight her daughter shall die this very night,meli lili sina li moli ala meli lili ona li moli wawa

61,hold your tongue you foolish beast scolded the woman there’s a pancake for you but you must say,meli ike li pakala e soweli li pana e moku sike tawa ona meli li toki e ni o toki e ni tawa mije mi

62,‘her daughter shall have much silver and gold his daughter is frozen quite stiff and cold’,‘meli lili sina li moli lete meli lili ona li jo e mani mute’

63,but the doggie ate up the pancake and barked saying,soweli li pini moku la ona li mu e ni tawa meli ike

64,his daughter shall wear a crown on her head her daughter shall die unwooed unwed,meli lili ona li jo e mije meli lili sina li moli lete

65,then the old woman tried to coax the doggie with more pancakes and to terrify it with blows,meli ike li pakala sin e soweli li pana e moku sin tawa ona

66,but he barked on,taso ni li suli ala tawa soweli

67,always repeating the same words,ona li awen mu sama

68,and suddenly the door creaked and flew open,lupa tomo li open

69,and a great heavy chest was pushed in and behind it came the stepdaughter radiant and beautiful in a dress all glittering with silver and gold for a moment the stepmother’s eyes were dazzled then she called to her husband,poki suli pi mani jelo mute li tawa insa tomo meli lili pona li kama ona li jo e len suno pona mama tu li lukin e ona mama meli ike li sona e kama la ona li toki e ni tawa mije ona

70,old man yoke the horses at once into the sledge and take my daughter to the same field and leave her on the same spot exactly,tenpo pini la sina weka e meli lili sina tawa ma suli o weka e meli lili mi tawa ma suli sama

71,and so the old man took the girl and left her beneath the same tree where he had parted from his daughter,mije li weka e meli lili li tawa tomo ona

72,in a few minutes king frost came past and looking at the girl,tenpo lili la jan lawa lete li kama

73,he said,ona li toki e ni

74,are you warm maiden,meli lili o sina seli ala seli

75,what a blind old fool you must be to ask such a question she answered angrily can’t you see that my hands and feet are nearly frozen,meli lili li toki utala e ni noka mi en luka mi li lete kin sina sona ala e ni la sina jan nasa

76,then king frost sprang to and fro in front of her questioning her,jan lawa lete li tawa musi lon poka ona li kama e lete li awen toki e ni meli lili o sina seli ala seli

77,and getting only rude rough words in reply till at last he got very angry and cracked his fingers and gnashed his teeth and froze her to death,meli lili li kalama utala li toki e nimi ike tawa jan lawa lete jan lawa lete li lete e nimi pi lon uta ona ona li moli lete

78,but in the hut her mother was waiting for her return and as she grew impatient she said to her husband,mama meli li awen lon tomo ona li toki e ni tawa mije ona

79,get out the horses old man to go and fetch her home,o kama jo e meli lili mi

80,but see that you are careful not to upset the sledge and lose the chest,taso o kama jo e poki suli mani kin

81,but the doggie beneath the table began to bark saying,soweli pi lon anpa supa li mu e ni

82,your daughter is frozen quite stiff and cold and shall never have a chest full of gold,meli lili sina li lete li moli li wile ala e poki suli mani

83,don’t tell such wicked lies scolded the woman,meli ike li pakala e soweli

84,there’s a cake for you now say ‘her daughter shall marry a mighty king’,

85,at that moment the door flew open,lupa tomo li open

86,and she rushed out to meet her daughter,ona li tawa meli lili ona li tawa mani ona

87,and as she took her frozen body in her arms,ona li jo e sijelo lete kepeken luka

88,she too was chilled to death,lete sijelo li moli e meli ike kin

89,how māui brought fire to the world,jan mawi li pana e seli tawa ma

90,wiremu grace,jan mali

91,one evening after eating a hearty meal māui lay beside his fire staring into the flames,tenpo pimeja wan la jan mawi li anpa lon poka pi seli ona li lukin e seli

92,he watched the flames flicker and dance,seli li tawa nasa li tawa musi

93,and thought to himself i wonder where fire comes from,jan mawi li pilin e ni seli li kama tan seme

94,māui being the curious person that he was decided that he needed to find out,jan mawi li jan pi wile sona

95,in the middle of the night,tenpo pimeja la

96,while everyone was sleeping,jan ante li lape la

97,māui went from village to village and extinguished all the fires,jan mawi li tawa ma ale li telo e seli ale

98,until not a single fire burned in the world,seli li lon ala

99,he then went back to his whare and waited,jan mawi li tawa tomo ona li awen

100,the next morning there was an uproar in the village,tenpo suno kama la jan ale li kalama mute

101,how can we cook our breakfast there’s no fire called a worried mother,mama wan li toki e ni mi ken seli e moku kepeken nasin seme seli li lon ala

102,how will we keep warm at night cried another,mama ante li toki e ni mi awen seli lon tenpo pimeja lete kepeken nasin seme

103,we can’t possibly live without fire the villagers said to one another,jan ale li toki e ni seli li lon ala la mi ale li ken ala lon

104,the people of the village were very frightened,jan pi ma tomo li ike pilin mute

105,they asked taranga who was their rangatira to help solve the problem,ona li toki e ni tawa jan lawa talana mi mute li pali e seme

106,someone will have to go and see the great goddess mahuika and ask her for fire said taranga,jan lawa talana li toki e ni jan li wile tawa meli sewi suli mapuwika li wile kama jo e seli tan ona

107,none of the villagers were eager to meet mahuika,jan ala li wile tawa meli mapuwika tan ni

108,they had all heard of the scorching mountain where she lived,meli mapuwika li lon nena suli seli

109,so māui offered to set out in search of mahuika,taso jan mawi li tawa meli mapuwika

110,secretly glad that his plan had worked,ona li pona pilin lon insa tan ni ona li ken kama sona e tan pi seli ale

111,be very careful said taranga,jan lawa talana li toki e ni tawa pona pali pona

112,although you are a descendant of mahuika,meli mapulika li mama pi kulupu mama sina

113,she will not take kindly to you if you try and trick her,taso sina ike tawa ona la ona li ike tawa sina

114,i’ll find the great ancestress mahuika and bring fire back to the world māui assured his mother,jan mawi li toki e ni tawa mama ona mi tawa meli mama suli mapuwika li pana e seli tawa ma

115,māui walked to the scorching mountain to the end of the earth,jan mawi li tawa nena suli seli lon pini ma

116,following the instructions from his mother,kepeken toki pi mama ona

117,and found a huge mountain glowing red hot with heat,

118,at the base of the mountain māui saw a cave entrance,ona li lukin e lupa lon anpa nena

119,before he entered māui whispered a special karakia to himself as protection from what lay beyond,ona li toki sewi kepeken kalama lili tan ni ona li wile awen lon

120,but nothing could prepare māui for what he saw when he entered the sacred mountain of mahuika,taso ona li tawa lupa la ijo suli wawa li lon

121,mahuika the goddess rose up before him,meli sewi mapuwika li tawa sewi

122,fire burning from every pore of her body,sijelo ona li seli

123,her hair a mass of flames,linja lawa ona li seli

124,her arms outstretched,luka ona li open

125,and with only black holes where her eyes once were,oko ona li lon ala li lupa pimeja taso

126,she sniffed the air,ona li kama jo e kon

127,who is this mortal that dares to enter my dwelling,ona li toki e ni sina lon tomo mi a jan ma ni li jan seme

128,māui gathered the courage to speak it is i māui son of taranga,jan mawi li toki e ni mi jan mawi pi jan talana

129,huh yelled mahuika māui the son of taranga,meli mapuwika li toki suli e ni a sina jan mawi pi jan talana anu seme

130,yes the last born māuitikitikiataranga,a jan sama ale mi li suli tawa mi mi jan mawi sikisiki a talana

131,well then māuitikitikiataranga welcome welcome to the essence of the flame,o sina kama pona tawa ma pi seli ale

132,welcome my grandchild,jan lili pi jan lili mi o kama pona

133,mahuika stepped closer to māui taking a deep sniff of his scent,meli mapuwika li tawa jan mawi li kama jo e kon ona

134,māui stood completely still,jan mawi li awen

135,even though the flames from mahuika’s skin were unbearably hot,taso seli pi meli mapuwija li seli mute

136,so… why do you come māuitikitikiataranga mahuika finally asked,meli mapuwija li toki e ni sina kama tan seme

137,māui said,jan mawi li toki e ni

138,the fires of the world have been extinguished,seli li lon ala ma

139,i have come to ask you for fire,mi kama tan ni mi wile e seli

140,mahuika listened carefully to māui and then she laughed,meli mapuwika li kute pona e toki pi jan mawi li toki musi e nimi a a a

141,she pulled a fingernail from one of her burning fingers and gave it to him,ona li pana e selo pi palisa luka wan tawa jan mawi

142,take this fire as a gift to your people,o pana e seli ni tawa kulupu sina

143,honour this fire as you honour me,o pilin e ni seli ni li suli sama mi

144,so māui left the house of mahuika taking with him the fingernail of fire,jan mawi li jo e selo seli li tawa weka

145,as māui walked along the side of the road he thought to himself,jan mawi li tawa lon nasin la ona li pilin e ni

146,what if mahuika had no fire left then where would she get her fire from,meli mapuwika li jo ala e seli la ona li kama jo e seli sin tan ma seme

147,māui couldn’t contain his curiosity,jan mawi li jan pi wile sona

148,he quickly threw the fingernail into a stream and headed back to mahuika’s cave,ona li weka e selo lon telo tawa li tawa tomo pi meli mapuwika

149,i tripped and fell said māui,jan mawi li toki e ni mi tawa li anpa a

150,could i please have another,o pana e selo sin tawa mi

151,mahuika was in a good mood,meli mapuwika li pona pilin

152,she hadn’t spoken to someone in quite some time,tenpo suli la ona li toki ala tawa jan

153,and she liked māui,jan mawi li pona tawa ona

154,she gladly gave māui another of her fingernails,ona li pana e selo sin tawa jan mawi

155,but māui soon extinguished this fingernail as well,taso jan mawi li telo e selo ni kin

156,and returned to mahuika with another excuse,li tawa meli mapuwika li toki e ni

157,a fish splashed my flame as i was crossing the river māui said,mi tawa lon telo tawa la kala li pana e telo tawa seli mi

158,mahuika provided another of her fingernails not suspecting that she was being tricked,meli mapuwika li pana e selo sin li pilin ala e ni jan mawi li toki e ijo pi lon ala

159,this continued for most of the day,jan mawi li awen pali sama ni

160,until mahuika had used all her fingernails and had even given up her toenails,meli mapuwika li pana e selo ale pi palisa luka ona e selo mute pi palisa noka ona

161,when māui returned to ask for another mahuika was furious,jan mawi li kama sin li wile e selo sin la meli mapuwika li ike pilin mute

162,she knew māui had been tricking her,ona li sona e ni jan mawi li toki e ijo pi lon ala

163,and threw the burning toenail to the ground,ona li weka anpa e selo wan pi palisa noka

164,instantly māui was surrounded by fire and chased from the cave,seli li sike e jan mawi jan mawi li tawa weka

165,māui changed himself into a hawk and escaped to the sky,ona li kama waso wawa li tawa sewi

166,but the flames burned so high that they singed the underside of his wings,taso seli li suli mute li seli e anpa pi selo ona

167,turning them a glowing red,

168,māui dived towards a river hoping to avoid the flames in the coolness of the water,jan mawi li tawa telo tawa li kama kala

169,but the immense heat made the water boil,taso seli li seli wawa e telo

170,māui was desperate he called on his ancestor tāwhirimātea for help,jan mawi li toki tawa mama tapilimateja pi tenpo pini

171,tāwhirimātea atua o ngā hau e whā āwhinatia mai,jan sewi wawa pi kon en sewi o pana e pona tawa mi

172,then a mass of clouds gathered and a torrent of rain fell to put out the many fires,kon mute li kama li pana wawa e telo mute tawa ma tawa seli

173,mahuika’s mountain of fire no longer burned hot,nena suli pi meli mapuwika li seli ala

174,mahuika had lost much of her power,meli mapuwika li jo ala e wawa mute

175,but still she was not giving up,taso ona li awen pali

176,she took her very last toenail and threw it at māui in anger,ona li weka e selo seli pini tawa jan mawi

177,the toenail of fire missed māui and flew into the trees,selo li tawa ala jan mawi li tawa kasi

178,planting itself in the mahoe tree,ona li lon insa kasi mapo

179,the tōtara,li lon kasi totala

180,the patete,li lon kasi patete

181,the pukatea,li lon kasi pukateja

182,and the kaikōmako trees,li lon kasi kawikomako

183,these trees cherished and held onto the fire of mahuika considering it a great gift,kasi ni li pona pilin li pilin e ni seli pi meli mapuwika li ijo suli

184,when māui returned to his village,jan mawi li tawa ma tomo ona la

185,he didn’t bring back fire as the villagers had expected,ona li jo ala e seli

186,instead he brought back dry wood from the kaikōmako tree,taso ona li jo e luka pi kasi kawimako

187,and showed them how to rub the dry sticks together forming friction which would eventually start a fire,li pana e sona pi open seli tawa jan pi ma tomo

188,the villagers were very happy,jan pi ma tomo li pona pilin mute tan ni

189,to be able to cook their food once more,ona li ken seli e moku

190,and to have the warmth of their fires at night to comfort them,li ken awen seli lon tenpo pimeja lete

191,māui satisfied his curiosity in finding the origin of fire,jan mawi li jan sona

192,although he very nearly paid the ultimate price in doing so,taso ante li kama la ken la jan mawi li moli

193,to this day the kahu the native hawk of aotearoa still retains the red singed feathers on the underside of its wings,selo anpa pi waso wawa kapu pi ma ajotejalowa li loje tan ni

194,a reminder of how close māui was to death,tenpo pini la jan mawi li ken moli

195,this is the story of how māui brought fire to the world,ni li toki ni jan mawi li pana e seli tawa ma

196,the epic of gilgamesh,toki pi jan lawa kikamesi

197,n k sanders,jan ote jan ante jan mali jan kipo

198,prologue gilgamesh king in uruk,jan kikamesi li jan lawa pi ma tomo uluku

199,i will proclaim to the world the deeds of gilgamesh this was the man to whom all things were known this was the king who knew the countries of the world he was wise he saw mysteries and knew secret things he brought us a tale of the days before the flood he went on a long journey was weary wornout with labour returning he rested he engraved on a stone the whole story,

200,in uruk,ma tomo uluku li lon

201,he built walls a great rampart,sinpin pi ma tomo uluku li sewi li suli sinpin ni li kiwen

202,and the temple of blessed eanna for the god of the firmament anu and for ishtar the goddess of love,tomo enana li tomo pi sewi meli inana

203,look at it still today the outer wall where the cornice runs it shines with the brilliance of copper and the inner wall it has no equal touch the threshold it is ancient approach eanna the dwelling of ishtar our lady of love and war,sinpin pi tomo enana li kiwen sinpin ni li walo sama suno o tawa tomo pi sewi meli inana o lukin

204,the like of which no latterday king no man alive can equal,jan ante li pali ala e tomo sama jan lawa ante li pali ala e tomo sama

205,climb upon the wall of uruk walk along it i say regard the foundation terrace and examine the masonry is it not burnt brick and good,jan seme li kama pali e ali ni

206,the seven sages laid the foundations,

207,gilgamesh was terrifying like a great wild bull,ona li suli jan kikamesi li utala sama soweli wawa ona li pakala e sinpin kiwen

208,when the gods created gilgamesh they gave him a perfect body shamash the glorious sun endowed him with beauty adad the god of the storm endowed him with courage,sewi meli ninsun en jan lawa lukapanta li mama ona taso sewi mama alulu li pona e sijelo ona

209,two thirds they made him god and one third man,wan ona wan li jan wan ona tu li sewi

210,the great gods made his beauty perfect,ona li suli li pona lukin

211,surpassing all others,jan kikamesi li wawa li sama sewi

212,1 the coming of enkidu,

213,gilgamesh went abroad in the world but he met with none who could withstand his arms till be came to uruk,jan ala li wile utala e ona

214,but the men of uruk muttered in their houses,jan pi ma tomo uluku li pilin ike tan jan kikamesi jan mute li tawa tomo pi jan sewi li toki e ni

215,‘gilgamesh sounds the tocsin for his amusement his arrogance has no bounds by day or night,sewi o jan kikamesi li suli li sona ona li wawa nimi ona li suli

216,no son is left with his father for gilgamesh takes them all even the children,jan kikamesi li kulupu e mije la ona li lawa e jan ni tawa utala tan ni la mama mute li pilin ike

217,yet the king should be a shepherd to his people,jan kikamesi li jan lawa pi pona ala anu seme

218,his lust leaves no virgin to her lover,jan kikamesi li kama jo e meli li unpa e ona

219,neither the warrior’s daughter nor the wife of the noble,tan ni la mama mute li pana e telo oko

220,yet this is the shepherd of the city wise comely and resolute’,jan kikamesi li jan lawa pi pona ala anu seme

221,the gods heard their lament the gods of heaven cried to the lord of uruk to anu the god of uruk ‘a goddess made him strong as a savage bull none can withstand his arms no son is left with his father for gilgamesh takes them all and is this the king the shepherd of his people his lust leaves no virgin to her lover neither the warrior’s daughter nor the wife of the noble’,sewi li kute e ni sewi an li lawa e sewi

222,when anu had heard their lamentation the gods cried to aruru the goddess of creation,ona li toki e ni tawa mama sewi alulu

223,‘you made him o aruru,tenpo pini la sina pali e jan

224,now create his equal let it be as like him as his own reflection his second self stormy heart for stormy heart,o pali e jan wawa sin o pali e jan pi sama jan kikamesi

225,let them contend together,mi wile e ni ona li utala e jan kikamesi

226,and leave uruk in quiet’,tan ni la jan pi ma tomo uluku li ken awen pona

227,so the goddess conceived an image in her mind and it was of the stuff of anu of the firmament she dipped her hands in water,mama sewi alulu li telo e luka

228,and pinched off clay she let it fall in the wilderness,ona li kama jo e ko telo li pana e ijo ni tawa ma supa

229,and noble enkidu was created,nasin ni la jan enkitu li kama lon

230,there was virtue in him of the god of war of ninurta himself,jan enkitu li suli li wawa

231,his body was rough he had long hair like a woman’s it waved like the hair of nisaba the goddess of corn his body was covered with matted hair like samugan’s the god of cattle,sijelo ona li jo e linja mute

232,enkidu ate grass in the hills with the gazelle and lurked with wild beasts at the waterholes he had joy of the water with the herds of wild game,ona en soweli li moku e kasi anpa ona en soweli li moku e telo

233,he was innocent of mankind he knew nothing of the cultivated land,jan enkitu li jan soweli ona li sona ala e ilo e tomo e jan ante

234,but there was a trapper,jan pi alasa soweli li lon ma ni ona li pali e lupa ma suli soweli li tawa insa lupa la jan ni li ken kama jo e ona jan li pali e ilo alasa kin ona li kama jo e soweli li moli e ona

235,who met him one day face to face at the drinkinghole for the wild game had entered his territory on three days he met him face to face and the trapper was frozen with fear,jan pi alasa soweli li lukin e jan enkitu wawa li pilin ike li wawa ala pilin

236,he went back to his house with the game that he had caught and he was dumb benumbed with terror his face was altered like that of one who has made a long journey,ona li tawa weka li tawa mama ona

237,with awe in his heart he spoke to his father,jan pi alasa soweli li toki e ni

238,‘father there is a man unlike any other who comes down from the hills,mama o jan soweli li kama tan ma nena

239,he is the strongest in the world he is like an immortal from heaven,ona li suli li wawa jan ala li wawa sama ona

240,i am afraid and dare not go near him,mi pilin ike

241,he ranges over the hills with wild beasts and eats grass,ona en soweli li moku e kasi anpa

242,he ranges through your land and comes down to the wells,ona en soweli li moku e telo

243,he fills in the pits which i dig and tears upmy traps set for the game,tenpo ali la ona li pakala e lupa ma mi e ilo mi

244,he helps the beasts to escape and now they slip through my fingers’,mi ken ala kama jo e soweli tan ona

245,his father opened his mouth and said to the trapper,mama li toki e ni

246,‘my son in uruk lives gilgamesh,jan lili mi o jan kikamesi li lon ma tomo uluku

247,no one has ever prevailed against him he is strong as a star from heaven,jan ala li wawa sama ona

248,go to uruk,o tawa o kama tawa ma tomo uluku

249,find gilgamesh extol the strength of this wild man,o toki e ijo pi jan wawa ni tawa jan kikamesi

250,ask him to give you a harlot a wanton from the temple of love,jan kikamesi li pana e meli unpa sanka tawa sina

251,return with her and let her woman’s power overpower this man when next he comes down to drink at the wells she will be there stripped naked and when he sees her beckoning he will embrace her and then the wild beasts will reject him’,tenpo kama la jan sanka li anpa e jan soweli ni kepeken unpa

252,so the trapper set out on his journey to uruk,jan pi alasa soweli li kama tawa ma tomo uluku

253,and addressed himself to gilgamesh saying ‘a man unlike any other is roaming now in the pastures he is as strong as a star from heaven and i am afraid to approach him he helps the wild game to escape he fills in my pits and pulls up my traps’,jan kikamesi li kute e ona

254,gilgamesh said,li toki e ni

255,‘trapper go back take with you a harlot a child of pleasure,jan pi alasa soweli o kama jo e meli unpa sanka pi tomo pi jan sewi

256,at the drinking hole she will strip and when he sees her beckoning he will embrace her,tenpo kama la ona li kepeken nasin meli tawa jan soweli ni

257,and the game of the wilderness will surely reject him’,tenpo lili kama la soweli pi jan ni li tawa weka tan ona

258,now the trapper returned taking the harlot shamhat with him,jan pi alasa soweli en jan sanka li tawa ma supa

259,after a three days’ journey they came to the drinking hole,tenpo suno pi mute lili pini la ona li kama lon ma supa

260,and there they sat down the harlot and the trapper sat facing one another and waited for the game to come for the first day and for the second day the two sat waiting,ona li awen

261,but on the third day the herds came they came down to drink and enkidu was with them,tenpo suno sin la soweli en jan soweli enkitu li kama

262,the small wild creatures of the plains were glad of the water and enkidu with them who ate grass with the gazelle and was born in the hills,jan soweli enkitu li moku e telo e kasi anpa poka soweli telo en kasi anpa li pona tawa ona

263,and she saw him the savage man come from faroff in the hills,jan sanka li lukin e jan soweli enkitu li kama tawa ona

264,the trapper spoke to her ‘there he is now woman make your breasts bare have no shame do not delay but welcome his love let him see you naked let him possess your body when he comes near uncover yourself and lie with him teach him the savage man your woman’s art for when he murmurs love to you the wild’ beasts that shared his life in the hills will reject him’,

265,she was not ashamed to take him she made herself naked and welcomed his eagerness as he lay on her murmuring love she taught him the woman’s art,meli li weka e len sama jan sanka li pilin e luka pi jan soweli enkitu meli sanka li unpa e mije enkitu mije enkitu li unpa e meli sanka

266,for six days and seven nights they lay together for enkidu had forgotten his home in the hills,tenpo suno mute la ona li unpa tenpo pimeja mute la ona li unpa

267,but when he was satisfied he went back to the wild beasts,ona li pini unpa la jan enkitu li lukin tawa soweli

268,then when the gazelle saw him they bolted away when the wild creatures saw him they fled,taso soweli li pilin ike tawa ona tan ni la soweli li tawa weka

269,enkidu would have followed,jan enkitu li wile tawa soweli

270,but his body was bound as though with a cord his knees gave way when he started to run his swiftness was gone and now the wild creatures had all fled away enkidu was grown weak,taso ona li wawa ala pilin ona li ken ala tawa wawa

271,for wisdom was in him,jan enkitu li kama pilin e ni ona li ken sona

272,and the thoughts of a man were in his heart,jan enkitu li pilin e ni mi ken sona mi pilin mi jan

273,so he returned and sat down at the woman’s feet,ona li kama tawa jan sanka li anpa

274,and listened intently,ona li lukin e sinpin ona li kute

275,to what she said,jan sanka li toki tawa jan enkitu ona li toki e ni

276,‘you are wise enkidu,jan enkitu o

277,and now you have become like a god,sina sama sewi

278,why do you want to run wild with the beasts in the hills,sina tawa poka soweli tan seme

279,come with me i will take you to strongwalled uruk to the blessed temple of ishtar and of anu of love and of heaven there gilgamesh lives who is very strong and like a wild bull he lords it over men’,o kama

280,when she had spoken enkidu was pleased he longed for a comrade for one who would understand his heart ‘come woman and take me to that holy temple to the house of anu and of ishtar and to the place where gilgamesh lords it over the people i will challenge him boldly i will cry out aloud in uruk i am the strongest here i have come to change the old order i am he who was born in the hills i am he who is strongest of all’,

281,she said ‘let us go and let him see your face i know very well where gilgamesh is in great uruk o enkidu there all the people are dressed in their gorgeous robes every day is holiday the young men and the girls are wonderful to see how sweet they smell all the great ones are roused from their beds o enkidu you who love life i will show you gilgamesh a man of many moods you shall look at him well in his radiant manhood his body is perfect in strength and maturity he never rests by night or day he is stronger than you so leave your boasting shamash the glorious sun has given favours to gilgamesh and anu of the heavens and enlil and ea the wise has given him deep understanding i tell you even before you have left the wilderness gilgamesh will know in his dreams that you are coming’,

282,now gilgamesh got up to tell his dream to his mother ninsun one of the wise gods,jan kikamesi li lukin lape ona li pini lape li tawa mama meli jan kikamesi li toki e ni

283,‘mother last night i had a dream,mama o tenpo pimeja la mi jo e sitelen lape

284,i was full of joy the young heroes were round me and i walked through the night under the stars of the firmament,mi lukin e mun lili mute lon sewi mi

285,and one a meteor of the stuff of anu fell down from heaven,mun pi sewi an li anpa lon poka mi

286,i tried to lift it,mi wile sewi e kiwen ni

287,but it proved too heavy,taso mi ken ala tawa e ona

288,all the people of uruk came round to see it the common people jostled and the nobles thronged to kiss its feet,jan pi ma tomo uluku li sike e mun ni

289,and to me its attraction was like the love of woman,mi anpa tawa ona sama ni mi anpa tawa meli

290,they helped me i braced my forehead and i raised it with thongs and brought it to you and you yourself pronounced it my brother’,mi toki e ijo ni tawa sina tawa ni sina ken pana e sona pi sitelen lape ni

291,then ninsun who is wellbeloved and wise said to gilgamesh,mama pi jan kikamesi li sona e ali sewi ninsun li sona e ali ona li sona e sitelen lape ni li toki e ni

292,’this star of heaven which descended like a meteor from the sky which you tried to lift but found too heavy when you tried to move it it would not budge and so you brought it to my feet i made it for you a goad and spur and you were drawn as though to a woman,mije lili mi o sitelen lape sina li ni

293,this is the strong comrade the one who brings help to his friend in his need,tenpo kama la jan wawa li kama tawa sina

294,he is the strongest of wild creatures the stuff of anu born in the grasslands and the wild hills reared him,ona li wawa sama mun pi sewi an

295,when you see him you will be glad you will love him as a woman and he will never forsake you,tenpo kama la ona li pona tawa sina ona li pana e pona tawa sina li utala e jan ike sina ona li jan sama sina sina olin e ona sama meli olin

296,this is the meaning of the dream’,mije lili o sitelen lape sina li pona li suli

297,gilgamesh said ‘mother i dreamed a second dream in the streets of strongwalled uruk there lay an axe the shape of it was strange and the people thronged round i saw it and was glad i bent down deeply drawn towards it i loved it like a woman and wore it at my side’ ninsun answered ‘that axe which you saw which drew you so powerfully like love of a woman that is the comrade whom i give you and he will come in his strength like one of the host of heaven he is the brave companion who rescues his friend in necessity’ gilgamesh said to his mother ‘a friend a counsellor has come to me from enlil and now i shall befriend and counsel him’ so gilgamesh told his dreams and the harlot shamhat retold them to enkidu,

298,and now she said to enkidu ‘when i look at you you have become like a god why do you yearn to run wild again with the beasts in the hills get up from the ground the bed of a shepherd’ he listened to her words with care it was good advice that she gave,

299,she divided her clothing in two,jan sanka li tu e len ona

300,and with the one half she clothed him and with the other herself,ona li len e jan enkitu kepeken len wan

301,and holding his hand she led him like a child to the sheepfolds,jan sanka li toki e ni o kama poka mi o kama tawa kulupu jan

302,into the shepherds’ tents,ona li tawa tomo pi jan pi lawa mani

303,there all the shepherds crowded round to see him,jan mute pi lawa pi mani mute li kulupu li lukin e jan enkitu li toki e ni ona li suli sama jan kikamesi ona li wawa sama suno pi sewi an

304,they put down bread in front of him but enkidu could only suck the milk of wild animals,ona li pana e pan e telo nasa jelo

305,he fumbled and gaped at a loss what to do or how he should eat the bread and drink the strong wine,jan enkitu li moku ala ona li lukin wawa taso tenpo ala la ona li lukin e pan e telo nasa

306,then the woman said,jan sanka li toki ni

307,‘enkidu eat bread it is the staff of life,jan enkitu o moku e moku ni

308,drink the wine,o moku e telo ni

309,it is the custom of the land’,ni li nasin jan

310,so he ate till he was full,jan enkitu li moku e pan mute

311,and drank strong wine seven goblets,ona li moku e telo nasa jelo mute

312,he became merry his heart exulted and his face shone,ona li pilin pona mute

313,he rubbed down the matted hair of his body and anointed himself with oil,ona li telo e sijelo ona

314,enkidu had become a man but when he had put on man’s clothing he appeared like a bridegroom,ona li len jan enkitu li jan kin

315,he took arms to hunt the lion so that the shepherds could rest at night he caught wolves and lions and the herdsmen lay down in peace for enkidu was their watchman that strong man who had no rival,jan pi lawa mani li lape la jan enkitu li lape ala ona li kama jo e ilo utala li utala e soweli ike jan pi lawa mani li ken lape pona

316,he was merry living with the shepherds till one day lifting his eyes he saw a man approaching,jan enkitu li tawa e oko li lukin e ni jan mije li tawa noka

317,he said to the harlot,jan enkitu li toki e ni

318,‘woman fetch that man here,jan sanka o mi wile e ni jan ni li tawa weka

319,why has he come i wish to know his name’,tan seme la ona li tawa

320,she went and called the man saying,jan sanka li toki e ni

321,‘sir where are you going on this weary journey’,jan ante o sina tawa tan seme sina sama lukin jan pi pilin ike sina pilin ike tan seme

322,the man answered saying to enkidu,jan mije li toki tawa jan enkitu li toki e ni

323,‘gilgamesh has gone into the marriagehouse and shut out the people,tenpo lili kama la mi en meli olin mi li wan

324,he does strange things in uruk the city of great streets at the roll of the drum work begins for the men and work for the women,

325,gilgamesh the king is about to celebrate marriage with the queen of love and he still demands to be first with the bride,taso jan kikamesi li jan lawa a ona li wile unpa e olin mi tenpo pimeja pi kama wan la jan kikamesi li unpa e olin mi

326,the king to be first and the husband to follow for that was ordained by the gods from his birth from the time the umbilical cord was cut,nasin pi kulupu pi jan sewi li ni tenpo pimeja pi kama wan la jan lawa li ken unpa e meli pi jan ante

327,but now the drums roll for the choice of the bride and the city groans’,

328,at these words enkidu turned white in the face,jan enkitu li pilin ike wawa tan toki pi jan ni

329,’i will go to the place where gilgamesh lords it over the people i will challenge him boldly and i will cry aloud in uruk i have come to change the old order for i am the strongest here,ona li toki e ni mi tawa ma tomo uluku jan kikamesi li unpa ala e meli sina

330,now enkidu strode in front,jan enkitu li tawa lon nasin pi ma tomo uluku

331,and the woman followed behind,jan sanka li tawa lon monsi ona

332,he entered uruk that great market,jan enkitu li lon supa pi ma tomo

333,and all the folk thronged round him where he stood in the street in strongwalled uruk the people jostled speaking of him they said,jan mute li kulupu lon poka ona li toki e ni

334,‘he is the spit of gilgamesh’ ‘he is shorter’ ‘he is bigger of bone’,

335,‘this is the one who was reared on the milk of wild beasts,jan ni li kama tan ma nena

336,his is the greatest strength’,ona li wawa

337,the men rejoiced,

338,‘now gilgamesh has met his match this greatone this hero whose beauty is like a god he is a match even for gilgamesh’,ona li suli sama jan kikamesi

339,in uruk the bridal bed was made fit for the goddess of love the bride waited for the bridegroom but in the night gilgamesh got up and came to the house then enkidu stepped out he stood in the street and blocked the way,jan enkitu li kama tawa tomo pi jan olin ona li awen lon sinpin pi lupa pi tomo ni ona li awen e noka ona lon sinpin pi tomo ni

340,mighty gilgamesh came on,jan kikamesi li kama

341,and enkidu met him at the gate he put out his foot and prevented gilgamesh from entering the house,taso ona li ken ala kama tawa insa tomo

342,so they grappled holding each other like bulls,ona li pilin ike wawa jan kikamesi li kama utala e jan enkitu jan enkitu li utala e jan kikamesi ona tu li utala

343,they broke the doorposts and the walls shook they snorted like bulls locked together they shattered the doorposts and the walls shook gilgamesh bent his knee with his foot planted on the ground and with a turn enkidu was thrown,poka pi lupa tomo li tawa ona li utala wawa poka pi lupa tomo li pakala ona li utala sama soweli wawa sinpin tomo li tawa

344,then immediately his fury died,jan kikamesi li pini e ike utala wawa ona li pini utala

345,when enkidu was thrown he said to gilgamesh,jan enkitu li toki tawa ona li toki e ni

346,‘there is not another like you in the world,jan kikamesi o jan ala li sama sina

347,ninsun who is as strong as a wild ox in the byre she was the mother who bore you and now you are raised above all men,sina wawa sama sewi mama sewi sina li kama e ni sina wawa

348,and enlil has given you the kingship for your strength surpasses the strength of men,sewi enli li kama e ni sina jan lawa

349,such is your destiny everlasting life is not your destiny because of this do not be sad at heart do not be grieved or oppressed he has given you power to bind and to loose to be the darkness and the light of mankind he has given you unexampled supremacy over the people victory in battle from which no fugitive returns in forays and assaults from which there is no going back,

350,but do not abuse this power deal justly with your servants in the palace deal justly before shamash’,jan kikamesi o pini pali e ike tawa jan pi ma tomo uluku ona li jan ike ala tawa sina sina jan lawa pi jan ni

351,so enkidu and gilgamesh embraced and their friendship was sealed,jan enkitu li uta e jan kikamesi jan kikamesi li uta e jan enkitu ona tu li kama jan sama kin

352,the epic of gilgamesh,jan kikamesi

353,n k sanders,jan ote

354,2 the forest journey,utala pi jan kuwawa

355,the eyes of enkidu were full of tears and his heart was sick he sighed bitterly,jan enkitu li toki ala ona li pilin ike li pana e telo oko

356,and gilgamesh met his eye and said,jan kikamesi li lukin e ona li toki e ni

357,‘my friend why do you sigh so bitterly’,jan sama o sina pilin ike tan seme

358,but enkidu opened his mouth and said,jan enkitu li open e uta ona li toki e ni

359,‘i am weak my arms have lost their strength the cry of sorrow sticks in my throat i am oppressed by idleness’,luka mi li kama wawa ala wawa mi li kama lili

360,it was then that the lord gilgamesh turned his thoughts to the country of the living on the land of cedars the lord gilgamesh reflected,

361,he said to his servant enkidu,jan kikamesi li toki tawa ona li toki e ni

362,’i have not established my name stamped on bricks as my destiny decreed,

363,therefore i will go to the country where the cedar is felled,o tawa mi tu o tawa nena pi kasi suli nena ni li weka tan ni ona li lon tawa nasin pi anpa suno kasi suli mute li lon ma ni palisa pi kasi ni li sewi li kiwen kasi suli sama li lon ala ma mi

364,i will set up my name in the place where the names of famous men are written and where no man’s name is written yet i will raise a monument to the gods,

365,because of the evil that is in the land we will go to the forest and destroy the evil for in the forest lives humbaba whose name is hugeness a ferocious giant,taso jan kuwawa li lon nena pi kasi suli jan li kama tawa kasi suli ni li wile pakala e ona li wile kama jo e ona la jan kuwawa li utala e ona li moli e ona jan kuwawa li ike li wawa mute mi wile e ni jan ike li lon ala ma o tawa sewi nena sina en mi li utala e ona li anpa e ona li moli e ona

366,but enkidu sighed bitterly and said,jan enkitu li toki e ni

367,‘when i went with the wild beasts ranging through the wilderness i discovered the forest its length is ten thousand leagues in every direction,

368,enlil has appointed humbaba to guard it and armed him with sevenfold terrors terrible to all flesh is humbaba,jan sama o jan sewi li wile e ni jan kuwawa li lon ma kasi ni jan sewi enli li wile e ni jan kuwawa li moli e jan

369,he guards the cedars so well that when the wild heifer stirs in the forest,soweli li tawa lon ma kasi la

370,though she is sixty leagues distant he hears her,jan kuwawa li ken kute e kalama lili weka

371,what man would willingly walk into that country and explore its depths,jan seme li ken kama tawa ma kasi ni

372,when he roars it is like the torrent of the storm,kalama uta pi jan kuwawa li sama kalama pi telo suli wawa

373,his breath is like fire and his jaws are death itself,uta ona li sama seli kon pi uta ona li sama moli

374,i tell you weakness overpowers whoever goes near it it is not an equal struggle when one fights with humbaba he is a great warrior a batteringram gilgamesh the watchman of the forest never sleeps’,sina wile utala e jan ni tan seme mi tu li wawa sama ala jan ni mi ken ala anpa e ona

375,gilgamesh replied,jan kikamesi li toki tawa jan enkitu li toki e ni

376,‘where is the man who can clamber to heaven,jan pona mi o jan seme li ken tawa sewi kon sewi

377,only the gods live for ever with glorious shamash,jan sewi taso li moli ala

378,but as for us men our days are numbered,tenpo suno mute pi jan ma li kama pini jan li moli

379,our occupations are a breath of wind,jan li pali e ijo taso ijo ali ni li sama kon

380,how is this already you are afraid,tenpo ni la sina pilin ike tan ni sina ken moli wawa sina li lon seme

381,i will go first although i am your lord,pona mi lawa e sina

382,and you may safely call out,tenpo pi tawa mi li kama la sina toki e ni tawa mi

383,forward there is nothing to fear,‘o tawa o pilin ike ala’

384,then if i fall i leave behind me a name that endures,jan ike ni li anpa e mi li moli e mi la

385,men will say of me,jan mute li toki e ni

386,gilgamesh has fallen in fight with ferocious humbaba,‘jan kikamesi li utala e jan wawa kuwawa li kama anpa li kama moli’

387,long after the child has been bony in my house they will say it,tenpo kama la jan lili mi li toki e ni ‘jan kikamesi li utala e jan wawa kuwawa’ tenpo mute kama la jan li toki e ni ‘jan kikamesi li utala e jan wawa kuwawa lon nena pi kasi suli li kama moli lon utala ni’

388,and remember’,nimi mi li kama suli

389,enkidu spoke again to gilgamesh ‘o my lord if you will enter that country go first to the hero shamash tell the sun god for the land is his the country where the cedar is cut belongs to shamash’,jan kikamesi li tawa tomo pi jan sewi utu

390,gilgamesh took up a kid white without spot and a brown one with it he held them against his breast and he carried them into the presence of the sun,ona li moli e soweli lili li sewi e luka ona

391,he took in his hand his silver sceptre and he said to glorious shamash,ona li toki e ni

392,‘o shamash hear me hear me shamash let my voice be heard,jan sewi utu o

393,i am going to that country o shamash i am going,mi wile kama tawa jan kuwawa li utala e ona

394,here in the city man dies oppressed at heart man perishes with despair in his heart i have looked over the wall and i see the bodies floating on the river and that will be my lot also indeed i know it is so for whoever is tallest among men cannot reach the heavens and the greatest cannot encompass the earth therefore i would enter that country because i have not established my name stamped on brick as my destiny decreed i will go to the country where the cedar is cut i will set up my name where the names of famous men are written and where no man’s name is written i will raise a monument to the gods,mi wile e ni nimi mi li kama suli

395,my hands supplicate so let it be well with my soul and bring me back to the quay of uruk grant i beseech your protection and let the omen be good’,sina sona li pona o pana e pona tawa mi o kama e ni mi anpa e jan wawa ni li jo e sijelo pona li tawa ma tomo uluku

396,the tears ran down his face and he said,jan kikamesi li pana e telo oko ona li toki e ni

397,‘alas it is a long journey that i must take to the land of humbaba if this enterprise is not to be accomplished why did you move me shamash with the restless desire to perform it how can i succeed if you will not succour me if i die in that country i will die without rancour but if i return i will make a glorious offering of gifts and of praise to shamash’,jan sewi utu o mi moli e jan kuwawa la mi toki mute e pona sina li pali e sitelen sina kiwen

398,so shamash accepted the sacrifice of his tears,telo oko pi jan kikamesi li pona tawa jan sewi utu

399,like the compassionate man he showed him mercy,ona li toki tawa jan kikamesi li toki e ni jan kikamesi o pilin pona

400,he appointed strong allies for gilgamesh sons of one mother the great winds he appointed,mi lawa e kon tawa

401,the scorching wind,mi jo e kon tawa seli

402,the icy wind,mi jo e kon tawa lete

403,the tempest,mi jo e kon tawa telo

404,the stone wind,mi jo e kon tawa pi ko kiwen lili

405,the north wind,mi jo e kon tawa tan ma lete

406,and the whirlwind,mi jo e kon tawa tan ma seli

407,like vipers like dragons like a scorching fire like a serpent that freezes the heart a destroying flood and the lightning’s fork such were they and gilgamesh rejoiced,o tawa nena pi kasi suli o utala e ike

408,he stationed these winds in the mountain caves,jan sewi utu li kulupu e kon tawa mute lon insa lupa pi nena kiwen

409,he went to the forge and said ‘i will give orders to the armourers they shall cast us our weapons while we watch them’ so they gave orders to the armourers and the craftsmen sat down in conference,jan kikamesi en jan enkitu li tawa jan pali pi ilo utala

410,they went into the groves of the plain and cut willow and boxwood they cast for them axes of nine score pounds,ona li pali e ilo suli pi kasi suli

411,and great swords they cast with blades of six score pounds each one with pommels and hilts of thirty pounds,e ilo palisa utala suli

412,they cast for gilgamesh the axe ‘might of heroes’ and the bow of anshan and gilgamesh was armed and enkidu and the weight of the arms they carried was thirty score pounds,li pana e ilo ni tawa ona

413,the people collected and the counsellors in the streets and in the marketplace of uruk,jan kikamesi en jan enkitu li tawa supa pi ma tomo

414,they came through the gate of seven bolts and gilgamesh spoke to them in the marketplace,jan lawa kikamesi li toki e ni

415,’i gilgamesh go to see that creature of whom such things are spoken the rumour of whose name fills the world,jan ali o kute mi wile kama tawa jan wawa kuwawa li moli e ona

416,i will conquer him in his cedar wood and show the strength of the sons of uruk all the world shall know of it i am committed to this enterprise to climb the mountain to cut down the cedar and leave behind me an enduring name’,mi wile kama tawa jan kuwawa li utala e ona li moli e ona nimi mi li kama suli nimi pi jan tan ma tomo uluku li kama suli

417,the counsellors of uruk the great market answered him,jan sona li toki tawa jan kikamesi li toki e ni

418,’gilgamesh you are young your courage carries you too far you cannot know what this enterprise means which you plan,jan lawa o sina wile utala e jan ike ni tan seme pilin sina li suli li wawa sama pilin pi jan lili taso sona sina li suli ala

419,we have heard that hurnbaba is not like men who die his weapons are such that none can stand against them the forest stretches for ten thousand leagues in every direction who would willingly go down to explore its depths,jan kuwawa li ike lukin li wawa mute

420,as for humbaba when he roars it is like the torrent of the storm,kalama uta pi jan kuwawa li sama kalama pi telo suli wawa

421,his breath is like fire and his jaws are death itself,uta ona li sama seli kon pi uta ona li sama moli

422,why do you crave to do this thing gilgamesh it is no equal struggle when one fights with humbaba that batteringram,sina ken ala anpa e ona wile sina li pona ala

423,when he heard these words of the counsellors gilgamesh looked at his friend and laughed,jan kikamesi li toki tawa jan enkitu li toki e ni

424,‘how shall i answer them shall i say i am afraid of humbaba i will sit at home all the rest of my days’,jan pona mi o jan ni li toki e nimi kuwawa taso la ona li pilin ike kin

425,then gilgamesh opened his mouth again and said to enkidu,jan kikamesi li toki tawa jan enkitu li toki e ni

426,‘my friend let us go to the great palace to egalmah and stand before ninsun the queen ninsun is wise with deep knowledge she will give us counsel for the road we must go’,jan pona o kama poka mi o tawa tomo suli pi mama sewi mi

427,they took each other by the hand as they went to egalmah and they went to ninsun the great queen,jan kikamesi li lawa e jan enkitu tawa tomo pi jan sewi nintu

428,gilgamesh approached he entered the palace and spoke to ninsun,ona li kama lon insa tomo li toki e ni

429,‘ninsun will you listen to me i have a long journey to go to the land of humbaba i must travel an unknown road and fight a strange battle from the day i go until i return till i reach the cedar forest and destroy the evil which shamash abhors,mama o mi wile kama tawa jan kuwawa ike li moli e ona

430,pray for me to shamash’,o toki pona e mi tawa jan sewi utu

431,ninsun went into her room she put on a dress becoming to her body,jan sewi nintu li telo e sijelo ona li len e len pona lukin

432,she put on jewels to make her breast beautiful,ona li pana e linja sike tawa anpa lawa ona

433,she placed a tiara on her head and her skirts swept the ground,

434,then she went up to the altar of the sun standing upon the roof of the palace she burnt incense and lifted her arms to shamash as the smoke ascended,jan nintu li tawa tomo sewi pi jan sewi utu li sewi e luka li toki e ni

435,‘o shamash why did you give this restless heart to gilgamesh my son why did you give it you have moved him and now he sets out on a long journey to the land of humbaba to travel an unknown road and fight a strange battle,jan sewi utu o sina li pilin ike tawa ike ali jan lili mi li wile anpa e ike jan kikamesi li wile anpa e jan wawa kuwawa

436,therefore from the day that he goes till the day he returns until he reaches the cedar forest until he kills humbaba and destroys the evil thing which you shamash abhor do not forget him but let the dawn aya your dear bride remind you always and when day is done give him to the watchman of the night to keep him from harm’,o pana e pona tawa jan lili mi

437,then ninsun the mother of gilgamesh extinguished the incense and she called to enkidu with this exhortation,jan sewi nintu li toki tawa jan enkitu li toki e ni

438,’strong enkidu you are not the child of my body but i will receive you as my adopted son you are my other child like the foundlings they bring to the temple,sina jan pona pi jan kikamesi sina jan sama pi jan lili mi jan enkitu o sina jan lili mi

439,serve gilgamesh as a foundling serves the temple and the priestess who reared him,jan lili mi o tawa poka jan kikamesi o pana e pona tawa ona o utala e ike ali poka ona

440,in the presence of my women any votaries and hierophants i declare it’,

441,then she placed the amulet for a pledge round his neck and she said to him ‘i entrust my son to you bring him back to me safely’,jan sewi nintu li toki e nimi pona wawa li pana e linja sike pi anpa lawa tawa jan enkitu

442,and now they brought to them the weapons they put in their hands the great swords in their golden scabbards and the bow and the quiver gilgamesh took the axe he slung the quiver from his shoulder and the bow of anshan and buckled the sword to his belt and so they were armed and ready for the journey,ona li kama tawa jan kikamesi li lawa ona li jo e ilo suli pi kasi suli e ilo utala palisa suli jan enkitu li tawa lon monsi pi jan kikamesi ona kin li jo e ilo pi kasi suli e ilo utala palisa

443,now all the people came and pressed on them,kulupu pi jan mute li tawa lon monsi jan enkitu li jo e ilo pi kasi suli

444,and said ‘when will you return to the city’,

445,the counsellors blessed gilgamesh and warned him ‘do not trust too much in your own strength be watchful restrain your blows at first the one who goes in front protects his companion the good guide who knows the way guards his friend let enkidu lead the way he knows the road to the forest he has seen humbaba and is experienced in battles let him press first into the passes let him be watchful and look to himself let enkidu protect his friend and guard his companion and bring him safe through the pitfalls of the road we the counsellors of uruk entrust our king to you o enkidu bring him back safely to us’,

446,again to gilgamesh they said ‘may shamash give you your heart’s desire may he let you see with your eyes the thing accomplished which your lips have spoken may he open a path for you where it is blocked and a road for your feet to tread may he open the mountains for your crossing and may the nighttime bring you the blessings of night and lugulbanda your guardian god stand beside you for victory may you have victory in the battle as though you fought with a child wash your feet in the river of humbaba to which you are journeying in the evening dig a well and let there always be pure water in your waterskin offer cold water to shamash and do not forget lugulbanda’,

447,then enkidu opened his mouth and said ‘forward there is nothing to fear follow me for i know the place where humbaba lives and the paths where he walks let the counsellors go back there is no cause for fear’,

448,when the counsellors heard this they sped the hero on his way ‘go gilgamesh may your guardian god protect you on the road and bring you safely back to the quay of uruk’,jan sona li toki tawa jan kikamesi li toki e ni o tawa jan sewi sina li pana e pona tawa sina

449,after twenty leagues they broke their fast after another thirty leagues they stopped for the night,ona li tawa nasin tawa pi nena pi kasi suli tenpo suno la ona li tawa ona li tawa weka mute tan ma tomo uluku

450,in the evenings they dug a well and offered cold water to shamash,tenpo pimeja li kama la ona li pali e lupa pi telo pona tenpo suno sin la ona li weka e telo pona lili tawa jan sewi utu jan sewi li lukin e ona li pilin pona tenpo suno sin la ona li tawa nasin pi nena pi kasi suli li tawa weka mute mute tan ma tomo tenpo pimeja sin la ona li pali e lupa pi telo pona li weka e telo pona lili tawa jan sewi

451,fifty leagues they walked in one day in three days they had walked as much as a journey of a month and two weeks they crossed seven mountains before they came to the gate of the forest,tenpo suno li kama ona li tawa sewi nena li kama tawa poka pi ma pi kasi suli

452,then enkidu called out to gilgamesh ‘do not go down into the forest when i opened the gate my hand lost its strength’,

453,gilgamesh answered him ‘dear friend do not speak like a coward have we got the better of so many dangers and travelled so far to turn back at last you who are tried in wars and battles hold dose to me now and you will feel no fear of death keep beside me and your weakness will pass the trembling will leave your hand would my friend rather stay behind no we will go down together into the heart of the forest let your courage be roused by the battle to come forget death and follow me a man resolute in action but one who is not foolhardy when two go together each will protect himself and shield his companion and if they fall they leave an enduring name’,

454,together they went down into the forest and they came to the green mountain there they stood still they were struck dumb,ona li awen li toki ala

455,they stood still and gazed at the forest,ona lukin taso e kasi suli mute

456,they saw the height of the cedar,ona li lukin e ni kasi suli li sewi mute

457,they saw the way into the forest and the track where humbaba was used to walk the way was broad and the going was good,nasin pona li lon insa pi ma pi kasi suli tenpo mute la jan kuwawa li tawa lon nasin ni noka ona li pali e nasin ni

458,they gazed at the mountain of cedars the dwellingplace of the gods and the throne of ishtar the hugeness of the cedar rose in front of the mountain its shade was beautiful full of comfort mountain and glade were green with brushwood,seli suno li ken ala kama tawa insa pi ma kasi tan ni kasi ni li suli mute pimeja ni li lete li pona

459,there gilgamesh dug a well before the setting sun he went up the mountain and poured out fine meal on the ground and said,ona li tawa nena suli loje walo jan kikamesi li weka e ko pan pona tawa ma li toki e ni

460,‘o mountain dwelling of the gods bring me a favourable dream’,nena o pana e lape pona tawa mi

461,then they took each other by the hand and lay down to sleep and sleep that flows from the night lapped over them,tenpo pimeja li kama jan kikamesi en jan enkitu li anpa ona tu li pilin e luka pi jan sama li lape

462,gilgamesh dreamed and at midnight sleep left him and he told his dream to his friend,jan kikamesi li pini wawa e lape ona li toki e ni

463,‘enkidu what was it that woke me if you did not,jan enkitu o sina toki ala toki tawa mi sina pilin ala pilin e mi lape mi li pini tan seme

464,my friend i have dreamed a dream get up look at the mountain precipice the sleep that the gods sent me is broken ah my friend what a dream i have had,mi lape li lukin e ni

465,terror and confusion i seized hold of a wild bull in the wilderness,mi utala e soweli wawa

466,it bellowed and beat up the dust,ona li tawa wawa e noka ona li tawa e ko kiwen

467,till the whole sky was dark,tan ni la kon li pimeja

468,my arm was seized and my tongue bitten,luka mi li wawa ala

469,i fell back on my knee,mi ken ala anpa e ona

470,then someone refreshed me with water from his waterskin’,jan ante li tawa mi li pana e telo tawa mi ona li pona

471,enkidu said,jan enkitu li toki e ni

472,‘dear friend the god to whom we are travelling is no wild bull though his form is mysterious that wild bull which you saw is shamash the protector,jan pona mi o lukin lape sina li pona jan kuwawa li nasa lukin li wawa lukin taso ona li sama ala soweli wawa ni soweli wawa pi lape sina li jan sewi utu

473,in our moment of peril he will take our hands,tenpo utala la ona li pana e pona tawa mi tu

474,the one who gave water from his waterskin that is your own god who cares for your good name your lugulbanda united with him together we will accomplish a work the fame of which will never die’,mama sina kin li pana e telo tawa sina ona li jan lawa lukapanta

475,gilgamesh said ‘i dreamed again we stood in a deep gorge of the mountain and beside it we two were like the smallest of swamp flies and suddenly the mountain fell it struck me and caught my feet from under me then came an intolerable light blazing out and in it was one whose grace and whose beauty were greater than the beauty of this world he pulled me out from under the mountain he gave me water to drink and my heart was comforted and he set my feet on theground’,

476,then enkidu the child of the plains said ‘let us go down from the mountain and talk this thing over together’ he said to gilgamesh the young god ‘your dream is good your dream is excellent the mountain which you saw is humbaba now surely we will seize and kill him and throw his body down as the mountain fell on the plain’,

477,the next day after twenty leagues they broke their fast and after another thirty they stopped for the night they dug a well before the sun had set and gilgamesh ascended the mountain he poured out fine meal on the ground and said ‘o mountain dwelling of the gods send a dream for enkidu make him a favourable dream’ the mountain fashioned a dream for enkidu it came an ominous dream a cold shower passed over him it caused him to cower tike the mountain barley under a storm of rain but gilgamesh sat with his chin on his knees till the sleep which flows over all mankind lapped over him then at midnight sleep left him he got up and said to his friend ‘did you call me or why did i wake did you touch me or why am i terrified did not some god pass by for my limbs are numb with fear my friend i saw a third dream and this dream was altogether frightful the heavens roared and the earth roared again daylight failed and darkness fell lightnings flashed fire blazed out the clouds lowered they rained down death then the brightness departed the fire went out and all was turned to ashes fallen about us let us go down from the mountain and talk this over and consider what we should do’,

478,when they had come down from the mountain gilgamesh seized the axe in his hand he felled the cedar,ona li tawa lon insa pi ma pi kasi suli jan kikamesi li lukin li toki e ni ni li kasi suli pona ona li kama jo e ilo li anpa e kasi suli jan enkitu li weka e palisa tan kasi suli ni

479,when humbaba heard the noise far off he was enraged,jan kuwawa li kute e kalama li pilin ike wawa

480,he cried out,ona li toki wawa e ni

481,‘who is this that has violated my woods and cut down my cedar’,jan seme li kama tawa ma mi li pakala e kasi suli mi

482,but glorious shamash called to them out of heaven ‘go forward do not be afraid’,

483,but now gilgamesh was overcome by weakness for sleep had seized him suddenly a profound sleep held him he lay on the ground stretched out speechless as though in a dream,jan kuwawa li pana e wawa sewi tawa kalama ni wawa sewi ni li sama kon li sama suno ona li tawa sama ilo moli linja jan kikamesi li kama anpa li lape

484,when enkidu touched him,ona li pilin e jan kikamesi kepeken luka ona

485,he did not rise,jan kikamesi li tawa ala

486,when he spoke to him he did not reply ‘o gilgamesh lord of the plain of kullab the world grows dark the shadows have spread over it now is the glimmer of dusk shamash has departed his bright head is quenched in the bosom of his mother ningal o gilgamesh how long will you lie like this asleep never let the mother who gave you birth be forced in mourning into the city square’,jan enkitu li toki wawa e ni jan kikamesi o jan sama o tenpo pi suli seme la sina li lape kin jan enkitu li tawa wawa e ona li toki wawa tawa ona

487,at length gilgamesh heard him,jan kikamesi li open e oko ona li tawa sewi

488,he put on his breastplate ‘the voice of heroes’ of thirty shekels’ weight he put it on as though it had been a light garment that he carried and it covered him altogether he straddled the earth like a bull that snuff’s the ground and his teeth were clenched,

489,‘by the life of my mother ninsun who gave me birth and by the life of my father divine lugulbanda let me live to be the wonder of my mother as when she nursed me on her lap,ona li toki e ni ike a

490,until we have fought this man if man he is this god if god he is the way that i took to the country of the living will not turn back to the city’,jan ni li jan ma anu jan sewi

491,then enkidu the faithful companion pleaded answering him,jan enkitu li toki e ni

492,‘o my lord you do not know this monster and that is the reason you are not afraid i who know him i am terrified his teeth are dragon’s fangs his countenance is like a lion his charge is the rushing of the flood with his look he crushes alike the trees of the forest and reeds in the swamp,jan kuwawa li wawa mute

493,o my lord you may go on if you choose into thus land but i will go back to the city i will tell the lady your mother all your glorious’ deeds till she shouts for joy and then i will tell the death that followed till she weeps for bitterness’,jan pona o tawa ala jan ni mi mute o tawa weka tan ma ni o tawa ma tomo uluku

494,but gilgamesh said,jan kikamesi li toki tawa jan enkitu li toki e ni

495,‘immolation and sacrifice are not yet for me the boat of the dead shall not go down nor the threeply cloth be cut for my shrouding not yet will my people be desolate nor the pyre be lit in my house and my dwelling burnt on the fire,mi wile lukin e jan ni li utala e ona

496,today give me your aid and you shall have mine what then can go amiss with us two all living creatures born of the flesh shall sit at last in the boat of the west and when it sinks when the boat of magilum sinks they are gone but we shall go forward and fix our eyes on this monster if your heart is fearful throw away fear if there is terror in it throw away terror take your axe in your hand and attack he who leaves the fight unfinished is not at peace’,o pilin pona jan tu li ken ala moli sina en mi li ken anpa e ona

497,then enkidu called out ‘o gilgamesh remember now your boasts in uruk forward attack son of uruk there is nothing to fear’ when he heard these words his courage rallied he answered ‘make haste close in if the watchman is there do not let him escape to the woods where he will vanish,jan sewi utu li toki tawa jan kikamesi li toki e ni o awen ala

498,he has put on the first of his seven splendours,jan kuwawa li len e wawa sewi wan taso

499,but not yet the other six,ona li jo e wawa sewi mute lon tomo ona

500,let us trap him before he is armed’,sina awen la ona li ken len e wawa sewi ali o tawa

501,humbaba came out from his strong house of cedar,ona tu li tawa wawa tomo pi jan kuwawa jan kuwawa li tawa ona

502,like a raging wild bull gilgamesh snuffed the ground the watchman of the woods turned full of threatenings he cried out,jan kikamesi li toki wawa e ni mi jan kikamesi li jan lawa pi ma tomo uluku jan kuwawa ike o kama moli ona li wile utala e jan kuwawa kepeken ilo utala palisa jan enkitu li kama tawa utala kin poka ona taso ona li ken ala utala e ona

503,humbaba nodded his head and shook it menacing gilgamesh and on him he fastened his eye the eye of death,jan kuwawa li tawa wawa weka tan nasin pi ilo utala kalama uta ona li sama kalama pi telo suli wawa uta ona li sama seli ona li utala la ma li pakala nena suli li tawa kon li kama pimeja

504,then gilgamesh called to shamash and his tears were flowing,jan kikamesi li pilin ike li pana e telo oko ona li toki e ni a ona li wawa mute mi ken anpa ala e ona

505,’o glorious shamash,jan sewi utu o

506,i have followed the road you commanded but now if you send no succour how shall i escape,o pana e pona tawa mi

507,glorious shamash heard his prayer,jan sewi utu li kute e toki pi jan kikamesi

508,and he summoned the great wind the north wind the whirlwind the storm and the icy wind the tempest and the scorching wind they came like dragons like a scorching fire like a serpent that freezes the heart a destroying flood and the lightning’s fork,ona li weka e kon tawa mute tan insa lupa pi nena kiwen kon tawa seli li utala e jan kuwawa kon tawa lete li utala e ona kon tawa telo li utala e jan kuwawa kon tawa pi ko kiwen lili li utala e ona kon tawa tan ma lete li utala e jan kuwawa kon tawa tan ma seli li utala e ona

509,the eight winds rose up against humbaba they beat against his eyes,kon tawa mute li utala e jan kuwawa

510,he was gripped unable to go forward or back,ona li ken ala tawa

511,gilgamesh shouted ‘by the life of ninsun my mother and divine lugulbanda my father in the country of the living in this land i have discovered your dwelling my weak arms and my small weapons i have brought to this land against you and now i will enter your house’,

512,so he felled the first cedar and they cut the branches and laid them at the foot of the mountain at the first stroke humbaba blazed out but still they advanced they felled seven cedars and cut and bound the branches and laid them at the foot of the mountain and seven times humbaba loosed his glory on them as the seventh blaze died out they reached his lair,tenpo ni la jan kikamesi en jan enkitu li ken tawa ona li ken utala e ona kepeken ilo utala ona

513,he slapped his thigh in scorn he approached like a noble wild bull roped on the mountain a warrior whose elbows are bound together the tears started to his eyes and he was pale,jan kuwawa li awen sinpin pi lawa ona li kama pona lukin ona li toki e ni

514,‘gilgamesh let me speak,jan kikamesi o kute e mi jan lawa wawa o moli ala e mi

515,i have never known a mother no nor a father who reared me,mi sona ala e mama mi

516,i was born of the mountain he reared me,nena suli li mama mi

517,and enlil made me the keeper of this forest,jan sewi enli li wile e ni jan li wile pakala e kasi suli ni la mi utala e ona li moli e ona

518,let me go free gilgamesh and i will be your servant you shall be my lord all the trees of the forest that i tended on the mountain shall be yours i will cut them down and build you a palace’,o pilin ike ala tawa mi mi wile e ni sina jan lawa mi mi anpa e kasi suli mi li pana e ona mute tawa sina o moli ala e mi o weka e mi

519,he took him by the hand and led him to his house so that the heart of gilgamesh was moved with compassion,jan kikemesi li pini pilin e ike tawa jan kuwawa

520,he swore by the heavenly life by the earthly life by the underworld itself,ona li toki tawa jan enkitu li toki e ni

521,‘o enkidu should not the snared bird return to its nest and the captive man return to his mother’s arms’,jan li kama jo e waso lili la jan li wile weka e ona li wile e ni ona li tawa mama ona ni li pona ala pona

522,enkidu answered,jan enkitu li toki e ni

523,‘the strongest of men will fall to fate if he has no judgement namtar the evil fate that knows no distinction between men will devour him,o kute ala e jan kuwawa ona li ike o weka ala e ona

524,if the snared bird returns to its nest if the captive man returns to his mother’s arms then you my friend will never return to the city where the mother is waiting who gave you birth he will bar the mountain road against you and make the pathways impassable’,sina weka e ona la ona li pakala e nasin tawa ma tomo uluku lon ma ni li utala e mi mute

525,humbaba said,jan kuwawa li toki e ni

526,‘enkidu what you have spoken is evil,jan enkitu o toki sina li toki ike li toki utala

527,you a hireling dependent for your bread,jan lawa sina li pana e moku tawa sina tan ni taso la sina tawa lon monsi ona

528,in envy and for fear of a rival you have spoken evil words’,tan ni la sina wile ala e ni jan kikamesi li jan lawa mi kin jan anpa o o toki ala

529,enkidu said ‘do not listen gilgamesh this humbaba must die kill humbaba first and his servants after’,jan enkitu li pilin ike wawa

530,but gilgamesh said ‘if we touch him the blaze and the glory of light will be put out in confusion the glory and glamour will vanish its rays will be quenched’,

531,enkidu said to gilgamesh ‘not so my friend first entrap the bird and where shall the chicks run then afterwards we can search out the glory and the glamour when the chicks run distracted through the grass’,

532,gilgamesh listened to the word of his companion he took the axe in his hand he drew the sword from his belt and he struck humbaba with a thrust of the sword to the neck and enkidu his comrade struck the second blow,ona li utala wawa e jan kuwawa kepeken ilo utala palisa li weka e lawa ona tan sijelo ona

533,at the third blow humbaba fell,jan kuwawa li anpa lon ma

534,then there followed confusion for this was the guardian of the forest whom they had felled to the ground for as far as two leagues the cedars shivered when enkidu felled the watcher of the forest he at whose voice hermon and lebanon used to tremble now the mountains were moved and all the hills for the guardian of the forest was killed,kasi suli mute li kalama sama pilin ike

535,they attacked the cedars the seven splendours of humbaba were extinguished so they pressed on into the forest bearing the sword of eight talents they uncovered the sacred dwellings of the anunnaki and while gilgamesh felled the first of the trees of the forest enkidu cleared their roots as far as the banks of euphrates,jan kikamesi en jan enkitu li anpa e kasi suli jan uluku li pali poka ona jan enkitu li toki e ni jan sewi utu li pona mute mi wile pali e sinpin suli pi lupa pi tomo ona kasi suli ni li pona mute tawa pali ni ona mute li anpa e kasi suli mute

536,they set humbaba before the gods before enlil they kissed the ground and dropped the shroud and set the head before him when he saw the head of humbaba enlil raged at them,jan sewi enli li tawa ma pi kasi suli ona li lukin li toki tawa ona tu li toki e ni

537,’why did you do this thing,sina moli e ona tan seme

538,from henceforth may the fire be on your faces,seli li pakala e sinpin sina

539,may it eat the bread that you eat,seli li moku e moku sina

540,may it drink where you drink’,seli li moku e telo sina

541,then enlil took again the blaze and the seven splendours that had been humbaba’s he gave the first to the river and he gave to the lion to the stone of execration to the mountain and to the dreaded daughter of the queen of hell,jan sewi enli li kama jo e wawa sewi pi jan kuwawa li tawa weka

542,they built a raft and returned home along the euphrates with the giant tree,ona li kama jo e kasi suli mute li tawa tan nena pi kasi suli tawa telo tawa pulatu ona li wan e kasi suli mute li pali e supa tawa mute ona li tawa lon supa ni li tawa e ona lon telo tawa kepeken palisa nasin ni la ona li tawa lon telo tenpo suno mute lili pini la ona li tawa ma tomo uluku

633,you put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel,sina pana e ijo lili lili wan sina tawa poki

635,you’ve gained all the experiences it had,ona li pana e sona ali pi poki ni tawa sina

640,you’d start remembering everything,sina kama sona sin e ali

654,things are different where i come from,ma mi la ijo li ante

670,so what’s the point of it all,seme li tan ali

671,seriously i asked seriously,mi toki e ni a sina toki pi wile sona e ni

672,you’re asking me for the meaning of life,sina wile sona e ni seme li tan ali

673,isn’t that a little stereotypical,jan ali li wile sona e ni

674,well it’s a reasonable question you persisted,sina toki pi awen pona e ni mi wile sona e tan

675,i looked you in the eye,mi lukin e oko sina

676,the meaning of life,tan ali

677,the reason i made this whole universe,en tan pi ma suli ni

723,an egg i answered,mi toki kin e ni sike mama taso

724,now it’s time for you to move on to your next life,tenpo ni la mi wile e ni mi sin e lon sina

725,and i sent you on your way,mi pana e sina tawa nasin sina

726,winniethepooh,soweli wini pu

729,hand in hand we come,luka lon luka la mi tu li kama 

730,christopher robin and i,jan kitopa jopin en mi 

731,to lay this book in your lap,tan ni mi tu li wile pana e lipu ni tawa sina

732,say you’re surprised,o toki e ni sina pilin pi sin nasa anu seme

733,say it’s just what you wanted,o toki e ni sina wile e ni taso anu seme

734,because it’s yours ,ona li ijo sina a

735,because we love you,tan ni mi tu li olin e sina

736,introduction,kama lipu

737,if you happen to have read another book about christopher robin you may remember that he once had a swan or the swan had christopher robin i don’t know which and that he used to call this swan pooh,sina lukin e sitelen pi lipu ante pi ijo pi jan kitopa jopin la ken la sina sona e ni tenpo pini la ona li jo e waso walo anu waso walo li jo e jan kitopa jopin mi sona ala en ona li pana e nimi pu tawa waso walo ni

738,that was a long time ago and when we said goodbye we took the name with us as we didn’t think the swan would want it any more,tenpo suli li kama lon pini pi ijo ni mi tu li toki kulupu e tawa pona li awen e nimi tan ni tawa mi tu la waso walo ni li awen ala wile e ona

739,well when edward bear said that he would like an exciting name all to himself christopher robin said at once without stopping to think that he was winniethepooh,ni la soweli pi luka wawa etuwa li toki e ni ona li wile jo e nimi pi sin nasa pi ona sama taso tenpo sama la jan kitopa jopin li toki e ni ona li soweli wini pu

740,and he was,a ona li ona

741,so as i have explained the pooh part,pona mi pana e sona pi soweli pu

742,i will now explain the rest of it,kama la mi pana e sona pi ale ante

743,you can’t be in london for long without going to the zoo,jan li lon ma tomo lantan la tenpo lili la ona li kama wile tawa ma sijelo

744,there are some people who begin the zoo at the beginning called wayin and walk as quickly as they can past every cage until they get to the one called wayout,jan pi mute wan li kama insa ona kepeken lupa tawawinsa li lukin tawa lon tenpo pi lili mute lon poka pi tomo sijelo ale tawa lupa pi tomo sijelo tawaweka

745,but the nicest people go straight to the animal they love the most and stay there,taso jan pi suwi sin li tawa pona tawa sijelo li awen lon ona li olin mute e ona

746,so when christopher robin goes to the zoo he goes to where the polar bears are and he whispers something to the third keeper from the left,sama ni la jan kitopa jopin li tawa ma sijelo la ona li tawa soweli walo pi luka wawa li toki pi kalama lili tawa jan sinpin nanpa mute

747,and doors are unlocked,lupa li kama open

748,and we wander through dark passages and up steep stairs until at last we come to the special cage,mi tu li tawa lon nasin pimeja li tawa sewi lon mute supa tawa tomo sijelo

749,and the cage is opened,tomo ni li kama open

750,and out trots something brown and furry,tan insa ona la ijo pimeja pi linja mute li kama

751,and with a happy cry of oh bear christopher robin rushes into its arms,jan kitopa jopin li toki wawa e soweli pi luka wawa o li tawa lon tenpo sama tawa luka ona

752,now this bear’s name is winnie,tenpo ni la nimi pi soweli ni pi luka wawa li wini

753,which shows what a good name for bears it is,ni li pana e sona ni ona li toki pona tawa soweli pi luka wawa

754,but the funny thing is that we can’t remember whether winnie is called after pooh or pooh after winnie,taso ni li musi mi tu li ken ala awen sona e ni soweli wini li kama jo e nimi ona tan soweli pu anu soweli pu li kama jo e nimi ona tan soweli wini

755,we did know once,tenpo pini wan la mi tu li sona

756,but we have forgotten…,taso mi tu li pini sona…

757,i had written as far as this when piglet looked up and said in his squeaky voice what about me,mi ken sitelen e nimi pi mute ni taso tan ni soweli lili li lukin e sewi li toki e ni kepeken uta lili seme mi li lon

758,my dear piglet i said the whole book is about you,mi toki e ni soweli pona mi pi palisa monsi sike o ale lipu li toki e ijo sina

759,so it is about pooh he squeaked,ona li toki e ni kepeken uta lili ni la ona li toki e ijo pi soweli pu

760,you see what it is,

761,he is jealous because he thinks pooh is having a grand introduction all to himself,ona li pilin pi lili ike tan ni nimi pi soweli pu li ken kama ijo suli tawa jan

762,pooh is the favourite of course,ni li sona soweli pu li pona mute tawa jan kitopa jopin

763,there’s no denying it,jan li ken ala toki e ijo ante

764,but piglet comes in for a good many things which pooh misses,taso soweli lili li jo e ijo pona soweli pu li jo ala e ona

765,because you can’t take pooh to school without everybody knowing it,jan li ken ala tawa tomo sona e soweli pu lon ni ala jan ale kama sona e ni

766,but piglet is so small that he slips into a pocket,taso soweli lili li lili ni ona li ken kama lon poki

767,where it is very comforting to feel him when you are not quite sure whether twice seven is twelve or twentytwo,jan li pilin sona ala e ni esun tu li luka tu en tu anu luka tu tu la ona li ken luka e soweli lili li kama sin pilin pona

768,sometimes he slips out and has a good look in the inkpot,tenpo pi mute wan la ona li kama weka li lukin pona e poki pi telo sitelen

769,and in this way he has got more education than pooh,a ona li kama sona e mute soweli pu li kama sona e lili

770,but pooh doesn’t mind,taso tawa soweli pu la ni li suli ala

771,some have brains and some haven’t he says,ona li toki e ni jan wan li jo e lawa jan ante li jo ala e ona

772,and there it is,a ni

773,and now all the others are saying what about us,tenpo ni la jan ante ale li toki e ni seme pi mi mute li lon

774,so perhaps the best thing to do is to stop writing introductions and get on with the book,tan ni la ken la mi wile pini sitelen e kama pi lipu ni li wile kama pali e lipu sama

775,a a m,jan a a m

776,chapter i,wan lipu nanpa wan

777,in which we are introduced to winniethepooh and some bees and the stories begin,ona la mi mute li kama sona e soweli wini pu e pipi kon pi ko suwi en toki li kama

778,here is edward bear coming downstairs now,ni la soweli pi luka wawa etuwa li tawa anpa kepeken mute supa

779,bump bump bump on the back of his head behind christopher robin,monsi lawa ona li kalama pun pun pun lon monsi pi jan kitopa jopin

780,it is as far as he knows the only way of coming downstairs,tawa ona la kepeken nasin ni taso la jan li ken tawa anpa kepeken mute supa

781,but sometimes he feels that there really is another way,taso tenpo pi mute wan la ona li pilin e ni nasin ante li lon

782,if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it,taso ona li ken ala toki insa e ni tan ni ona li ken ala pini kalama pun

783,and then he feels that perhaps there isn’t,tenpo ante la ona li pilin e ni nasin ante li lon ala

784,anyhow here he is at the bottom and ready to be introduced to you winniethepooh,taso tenpo ni la ona li lon anpa en en jan li ken kama sona e nimi ona wini pu

785,when i first heard his name i said just as you are going to say but i thought he was a boy,mi kute e nimi ona lon tenpo nanpa wan la mi sama sina mi toki e ni taso tawa mi la ona li mije

786,so did i said christopher robin,tawa mi a li toki pi jan kitopa jopin

787,then you can’t call him winnie,tan ni la sina ken ala pana e nimi ‘wini’ tawa ona

788,i don’t,ala

789,but you said ,taso sina toki e ni 

790,he’s winnietherpooh,ona li soweli wini pu

791,don’t you know what ‘ther’ means,seme anu sina sona ala e kon pi nimi ‘pu’

792,ah yes now i do i said quickly,a sona li toki lon tenpo lili

793,and i hope you do too because it is all the explanation you are going to get,sama ni la sina o toki e ni tan ni sina ken kama jo e toki pona ni taso

794,sometimes winniethepooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs,tenpo pi mute wan la soweli wini pu li kama lon anpa kepeken mute supa li wile musi

795,and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story,tenpo ante la ona li wile kalama ala lon sinpin seli li wile kute e toki

796,this evening ,tenpo pimeja kama ni la 

797,what about a story said christopher robin,seme toki li lon li toki pi jan kitopa jopin

798,what about a story i said,seme toki li lon li toki mi

799,could you very sweetly tell winniethepooh one,o pona o toki e wan tawa soweli wini pu

800,i suppose i could i said,tawa mi la ken la mi ken li toki mi

801,what sort of stories does he like,toki seme li pona tawa ona

802,about himself,toki pi ona sama

803,because he’s that sort of bear,ona li soweli ni pi luka wawa

804,oh i see,a mi sona

805,so could you very sweetly,ni la sina pona anu seme

806,i’ll try i said,mi lukin ni li toki mi

807,so i tried,ni mi lukin ni

808,,

809,once upon a time a very long time ago now about last friday winniethepooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of sanders,tenpo wan pini pi weka mute pini pi tenpo esun pini la soweli wini pu li lon ma pi kasi suli li wan taso li lon anpa pi nimi santa

810,what does ‘under the name’ mean asked christopher robin,kon pi nimi ‘lon anpa nimi’ li seme li toki pi wile sona pi jan kitopa jopin

811,it means he had the name over the door in gold letters and lived under it,ni li sama nimi ‘ona li jo e nimi lon sewi pi lupa tomo li lon anpa’

812,winniethepooh wasn’t quite sure said christopher robin,soweli wini pu li pilin sona ala li toki pi jan kitopa jopin

813,now i am said a growly voice,tenpo ni la mi pilin sona li toki kepeken uta suli

814,then i will go on said i,ni la mi awen pali li toki mi

815,one day when he was out walking he came to an open place in the middle of the forest,tenpo suno wan la ona li weka li tawa la ona li kama lon ma taso lon insa pi ma pi kasi suli

816,and in the middle of this place was a large oaktree,insa ona la kasi suli li lon

817,and from the top of the tree there came a loud buzzingnoise,tan lawa pi kasi suli la kalama sss wawa li kama

818,winniethepooh sat down at the foot of the tree put his head between his paws and began to think,soweli wini pu li kama anpa lon noka pi kasi suli li lon luka tu ona e lawa ona li kama toki insa

819,first of all he said to himself,tenpo nanpa wan la ona li toki insa e ni

820,that buzzingnoise means something,kon pi kalama ‘sss’ ni li lon

821,you don’t get a buzzingnoise like that just buzzing and buzzing without its meaning something,kalama ‘sss’ li kama ala tan ala li awen kalama ‘sss’ taso ala li jo ala e kon ala

822,if there’s a buzzingnoise somebody’s making a buzzingnoise,kalama ‘sss’ li lon la jan a li kalama ‘sss’

823,and the only reason for making a buzzingnoise that i know of is because you’re a bee,mi sona e ni jan li kalama ‘sss’ tan ni taso jan ni li pipi kon pi ko suwi

824,then he thought another long time and said,tenpo suli sin la ona li toki insa li toki e ni

825,and the only reason for being a bee that i know of is making honey,mi sona e ni jan li pipi kon pi ko suwi tan ni taso jan ni li pali e ko suwi

826,and then he got up and said,ni la ona li kama sinpin li toki e ni

827,and the only reason for making honey is so as i can eat it,mi sona e ni jan li pali e ko suwi tan ni taso mi ken moku e ona

828,so he began to climb the tree,ni la ona li kama tawa lawa pi kasi suli kepeken noka en luka

829,he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself it went like this,ona li tawa sewi li tawa sewi li tawa sewi li kalama musi lili e ni tawa ona sama

830,isn’t it funny,ni li nasa anu seme

831,how a bear likes honey,ko suwi li pona tawa soweli pi luka wawa

832,buzz buzz buzz,sss sss sss

833,i wonder why he does,mi wile sona e ni tan seme la ona li ni

834,then he climbed a little further … and a little further … and then just a little further,ona li tawa lili li tawa lili li tawa lili

835,by that time he had thought of another song,ni la ona li lon e kalama musi sin

836,it’s a very funny thought that if bears were bees,ni li sitelen insa musi soweli pi luka wawa li pipi kon pi ko suwi la

837,they’d build their nests at the bottom of trees,ona li lon noka pi kasi suli e tomo ona

838,and that being so if the bees were bears,ni  pipi kon pi ko suwi li soweli pi luka wawa  la

839,we shouldn’t have to climb up all these stairs,mi ale li wile ala tawa sewi kepeken mute supa suli ni

840,he was getting rather tired by this time,tenpo ni la ona li kama wile lape

841,so that is why he sang a complaining song,tan ni la ona li kalama pi pilin ike

842,he was nearly there now,ona li weka pi lili taso tan pini nasin

843,and if he just stood on that branch…,ona li ken noka e palisa kasi ni taso la …

844,crack,ka

845,oh help said pooh as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him,o pana e pona li toki pi soweli pu lon tenpo ni ona li kiwen utala tawa palisa kasi lon anpa

846,if only i hadn’t  he said as he bounced twenty feet on to the next branch,mi ike –  li toki ona lon tenpo ni ona li kiwen utala tawa palisa kasi ante lon anpa sin

847,you see what i meant to do he explained as he turned headoverheels,o sona e ni taso mi wile e ni li toki ona lon tenpo ni lawa li kama lon anpa noka

848,and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below,ona li kiwen utala tawa palisa kasi ante lon anpa sin sin

849,what i meant to do ,taso mi wile e ni  

850,of course it was rather  he admitted as he slithered very quickly through the next six branches,taso ni li sona   li toki ona lon tenpo ni tenpo pi lili mute la ona li tawa lon ale poka pi palisa kasi mute tu

851,it all comes i suppose he decided as he said goodbye to the last branch spun round three times and flew gracefully into a gorsebush,tawa mi la ale ni li tan ni li toki sona ona lon tenpo ni ona li toki e tawa pona tawa palisa kasi pi nanpa pini li tawa sike lon tenpo mute li tawa lon kon tawa kasi pi palisa utala

852,it all comes of liking honey so much,ale li tan ni tawa jan la ko suwi li pona ni

853,oh help,o pana e pona

854,he crawled out of the gorsebush brushed the prickles from his nose and began to think again,ona li tawa weka tan kasi pi palisa utala li weka e wan pi palisa utala tan nena pi sinpin lawa ona li kama toki insa lon tenpo sin

855,and the first person he thought of was christopher robin,jan nanpa wan pi toki insa ona li jan kitopa jopin

856,was that me said christopher robin in an awed voice,mi li toki pi jan kitopa jopin tan pilin pi sin nasa

857,hardly daring to believe it,tawa ona la ni li ike sona

858,that was you,sina

859,christopher robin said nothing,jan kitopa jopin li toki ala

860,but his eyes got larger and larger,taso lukin ona li kama suli li kama suli sin

861,and his face got pinker and pinker,sinpin lawa ona li kama loje li kama loje sin

862,so winniethepooh went round to his friend christopher robin,ni la soweli wini pu li tawa jan pona ona kitopa jopin

863,who lived behind a green door in another part of the forest,tomo ona li lon wan ante pi ma pi kasi suli li jo e lupa tomo laso

864,good morning christopher robin he said,tenpo suno pona jan kitopa jopin o li toki ona

865,good morning winnietherpooh said you,tenpo suno pona soweli wini pu o li toki sina

866,i wonder if you’ve got such a thing as a balloon about you,mi wile sona e ni sina jo e sike kon kule lon poka sike sina anu seme

867,a balloon,sike kon kule

868,yes,sike kon kule

869,i just said to myself coming along,mi tawa ni mi toki e ni tawa mi sama

870,‘i wonder if christopher robin has such a thing as a balloon about him’,‘jan kitopa jopin li jo e sike kon kule anu seme’

871,i just said it to myself,mi toki e ni tawa mi sama

872,thinking of balloons,mi toki insa e ijo pi sike kon

873,and wondering,mi kama wile sona

874,what do you want a balloon for you said,tan seme la sina wile e sike kon li toki sina

875,winniethepooh looked round to see that nobody was listening,soweli wini pu li lukin tawa poka sike ona li lukin e ni jan ala li kute

876,put his paw to his mouth and said in a deep whisper,ona li lon uta ona e luka ona li toki kepeken uta suli e ni

877,honey,ko suwi

878,but you don’t get honey with balloons,taso jan li ken ala alasa e ko suwi kepeken sike kon

879,i do said pooh,mi ken li toki pi soweli pu

880,well it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at the house of your friend piglet,a tenpo suno pini la sina lon kulupu musi lon tomo pi jan pona soweli lili

881,and you had balloons at the party,sina jo e sike kon mute lon kulupu musi ni

882,you had had a big green balloon,sina jo e sike kon suli pi laso kasi

883,and one of rabbit’s relations had had a big blue one,jan poka pi soweli pi kute suli li jo e wan suli pi laso sewi

884,and had left it behind being really too young to go to a party at all,ona li awen e sike kon lon ni li tawa weka tan ni ona li lili ike li ken ala lon kulupu musi a

885,and so you had brought the green one and the blue one home with you,ni la sina tawa tomo sina e wan pi laso kasi e wan pi laso sewi

886,which one would you like you asked pooh,sina wile e ona seme li toki sina tawa soweli pu

887,he put his head between his paws and thought very carefully,ona li lon luka ona e lawa ona li toki insa li pilin lon tenpo suli

888,it’s like this he said,ni li lon li toki ona

889,when you go after honey with a balloon the great thing is not to let the bees know you’re coming,jan li alasa e ko suwi kepeken sike kon la ni li suli tawa pipi kon pi ko suwi la jan li pana ala e sona ni ona li kama

890,now if you have a green balloon they might think you were only part of the tree,tan ni la jan li jo e sike kon pi laso kasi la tawa ona mute la jan li wan pi kasi suli

891,and not notice you,kepeken ni la ona mute li ken ala kama lukin e jan

892,and if you have a blue balloon they might think you were only part of the sky,jan li jo e sike kon pi laso sewi la tawa ona mute la jan li wan sewi

893,and not notice you,kepeken ni la ona mute li ken ala kama lukin e jan

894,and the question is,mi wile sona e ni

895,which is most likely,seme li ken suli

896,wouldn’t they notice you underneath the balloon you asked,seme anu ona li kama lukin e sina lon anpa pi sike kon li toki sina

897,they might or they might not said winniethepooh,ken anu ken ala li toki pi soweli wini pu

898,you never can tell with bees,tenpo ala la jan li ken kama sona e ijo pi pipi kon pi ko suwi

899,he thought for a moment and said,tenpo lili la ona li toki insa li toki e ni

900,i shall try to look like a small black cloud,mi o lukinsama kontelopimejalili lon sewi

901,that will deceive them,kepeken ni la ona mute li ken ala kama sona

902,then you had better have the blue balloon you said,ni la sina o jo e sike kon pi laso sewi li toki sina

903,and so it was decided,ni li kama

904,well you both went out with the blue balloon,ni la sina tu li tawa weka li jo e sike kon pi laso sewi

905,and you took your gun with you just in case as you always did,sina li tawa li jo e ilo alasa tan ken pi ike kama sina pali ni lon tenpo ale

906,and winniethepooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of,soweli wini pu li tawa ma telo ona li sona e ona

907,and rolled and rolled until he was black all over,ona li anpa lon supa ona li tawa sike li tawa sike li pini kama e ni selo ona ale li kama pimeja

908,and then when the balloon was blown up as big as big,pini ni la sike kon li kama suli ale

909,and you and pooh were both holding on to the string,sina en soweli pu li awen e linja

910,you let go suddenly,tenpo lili la sina pini awen e ona

911,and pooh bear floated gracefully up into the sky and stayed there  level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from it,soweli pi luka wawa pu li pona lukin li lon kon li tawa sewi li awen lon ni  li lon sewi sama lawa pi kasi suli li lon weka ona

912,hooray you shouted,pona a li toki wawa sina

913,isn’t that fine shouted winniethepooh down to you,seme anu ni li pona li toki wawa pi soweli wini pu tawa sina lon anpa

914,what do i look like,

915,you look like a bear holding on to a balloon you said,sina sama soweli pi luka wawa ona li awen e sike kon li toki sina

916,not said pooh anxiously  not like a small black cloud in a blue sky,soweli pu li pilin akesi li toki e ni seme anu mi sama ala kon telo pimeja lili lon sewi laso

917,not very much,mute ala

918,ah well perhaps from up here it looks different,a ken la tawa sewi ni la ni li ante

919,and as i say you never can tell with bees,mi toki a e ni tenpo ala la jan li ken kama sona e ijo pi pipi kon pi ko suwi

920,there was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree,kon ala li tawa poka pi kasi suli e ona

921,so there he stayed,tan ni la ona li awen lon ni

922,he could see the honey he could smell the honey but he couldn’t quite reach the honey,ona li ken lukin e ko suwi li ken pilin e kon ona taso ona li ken ala luka e ko suwi

923,after a little while he called down to you,pini pi tenpo lili la ona li toki wawa tawa sina lon anpa

924,christopher robin he said in a loud whisper,jan kitopa jopin o li toki kon wawa ona

925,hallo,toki

926,i think the bees suspect something,tawa mi la pipi kon pi ko suwi li pilin pi ken pi ike kama

927,what sort of thing,ike seme

928,i don’t know,mi sona ala

929,but something tells me that they’re suspicious,taso tan ijo la tawa mi la ona mute li pilin pi ken pi ike kama

930,perhaps they think that you’re after their honey,ken la tawa ona mute la sina wile alasa e ko suwi ona

931,it may be that,ken

932,you never can tell with bees,tenpo ala la jan li ken kama sona e ijo pi pipi kon pi ko suwi

933,there was another little silence,weka kalama lili sin li lon

934,and then he called down to you again,pini ona la ona li toki wawa tawa sina lon tenpo sin

935,christopher robin,jan kitopa jopin o

936,yes,a

937,have you an umbrella in your house,sina jo e len utala tawa telo tan sewi anu seme

938,i think so,tawa mi la jo

939,i wish you would bring it out here,mi wile e ni sina lon ni e ona

940,and walk up and down with it,sina tawa mute lon nasin sama

941,and look up at me every now and then,

942,and say ‘tuttut it looks like rain’,sina toki e ni mumu tawa mi la telo li kama lon tan sewi

943,i think if you did that it would help the deception which we are practising on these bees,tawa mi la sina pali ni la ni li pana e pona ni mi tu li ken lawa ike e pipi kon pi ko suwi

944,well you laughed to yourself silly old bear,a sina a musi tawa sina sama e ni soweli nasa pi luka wawa o

945,but you didn’t say it aloud because you were so fond of him,taso sina toki kalama ala tan ni tawa sina la ona li pona suli

946,and you went home for your umbrella,tan ni la sina tawa tomo sina wile e len utala tawa telo tan sewi

947,oh there you are called down winniethepooh as soon as you got back to the tree,a sina kama lon a li toki wawa pi soweli wini pu tawa anpa lon tenpo ni sina kama sin lon kasi suli

948,i was beginning to get anxious,mi kama pilin akesi

949,i have discovered that the bees are now definitely suspicious,mi kama sona e ni pipi kon pi ko suwi li kama sona e ken pi kama ike

950,shall i put my umbrella up you said,mi o sinpin e len utala tawa telo tan sewi anu seme li toki sina

951,yes but wait a moment,sinpin taso o awen lon tenpo lili

952,we must be practical,mi o kama lukin e pona pali

953,the important bee to deceive is the queen bee,pipi kon suli pi ko suwi li pipi lawa taso mi tu o toki ike e ona

954,can you see which is the queen bee from down there,sina lon anpa li ken lukin e pipi lawa anu seme

955,no,ala

956,a pity,ike

957,well now if you walk up and down with your umbrella saying ‘tuttut it looks like rain’,ni la o tawa mute lon nasin sama o toki e ni mumu tawa mi la telo li kama lon tan sewi

958,i shall do what i can by singing a little cloud song such as a cloud might sing…,mi ken pali ni taso mi pana e kalama musi pi kon telo lon sewi sama kon telo lon sewi…

959,go,o tawa

960,so while you walked up and down,ni la sina tawa mute lon nasin sama

961,and wondered if it would rain,sina toki e ni sina wile sona e ni telo tan sewi li kama anu seme

962,winniethepooh sang this song,tenpo sama la soweli wini pu li kalama musi e ni

963,how sweet to be a cloud,ni li suwi ijo li kon telo lon sewi

964,floating in the blue,li kon lon laso sewi

965,every little cloud,kon telo lili ale lon sewi

966,always sings aloud,li kalama musi e ni

967,how sweet to be a cloud,ni li suwi ijo li kon telo lon sewi

968,floating in the blue,li kon lon laso sewi

969,it makes him very proud,ona li pilin suli tan ni

970,to be a little cloud,ona li kon telo lili lon sewi

971,the bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever,sama tenpo pini ale la pipi kon pi ko suwi li kalama sss ni ona li pilin pi ken pi ike kama

972,some of them indeed left their nests and flew all round the cloud as it began the second verse of this song,a wan ona li tawa weka tan tomo ona li tawa lon poka sike pi kon telo lon sewi lon tenpo ni ona li pana e pini pi kalama musi ni

973,and one bee sat down on the nose of the cloud for a moment and then got up again,pipi kon wan pi ko suwi li kama anpa lon nena sinpin pi kon telo lon sewi lon tenpo lili li tawa weka

974,christopher  ow,jan kitopa  a

975, robin called out the cloud, jopin o li toki wawa pi kon telo lon sewi

976,yes,a

977,i have just been thinking,mi pini toki insa

978,and i have come to a very important decision,mi kama sona e ijo pi suli mute

979,these are the wrong sort of bees,pipi kon ni pi ko suwi li ike

980,are they,ni

981,quite the wrong sort,ike a

982,so i should think they would make the wrong sort of honey shouldn’t you,tan ni la ni li kama tawa mi ko suwi ona li ike

983,would they,ni

984,yes,a

985,so i think i shall come down,tan ni la mi wile kama sin lon anpa

986,how asked you,kepeken seme li toki sina

987,winniethepooh hadn’t thought about this,soweli wini pu li kama ala sona e ni

988,if he let go of the string he would fall  bump ,ona li weka e luka tan linja la ona li kiwen utala tawa anpa  pun

989,and he didn’t like the idea of that,tawa ona la ni li pona ala

990,so he thought for a long time and then he said,tan ni la ona li toki insa lon tenpo suli li toki e ni

991,christopher robin you must shoot the balloon with your gun,jan kitopa jopin o sina o tan e kiwen utala tawa sike kon kepeken ilo alasa sina

992,have you got your gun,ona li lon sina anu seme

993,of course i have you said,ni li sona lon li toki sina

994,but if i do that it will spoil the balloon you said,taso mi pali ni la ni li pakala e kon sike li toki sina

995,but if you don’t said pooh i shall have to let go,taso sina pali ni ala la  li toki pi soweli pu  mi wile weka e luka

996,and that would spoil me,ni li pakala e mi a

997,when he put it like this you saw how it was and you aimed very carefully at the balloon and fired,kepeken nimi ona ni la sina kama sona li lawa e ilo alasa tawa sike kon kepeken pilin mute li tan e kiwen utala

998,ow said pooh,a li toki pi soweli pu

999,did i miss you asked,mi tawa ijo ante e kiwen utala anu seme li toki sina

1000,you didn’t exactly miss said pooh but you missed the balloon,tawa ijo ante ala  li toki pi soweli pu  taso tawa sike kon ala

1001,i’m so sorry you said,mi pilin ike li toki sina

1002,and you fired again,sina tan e kiwen utala lon tenpo sin

1003,and this time you hit the balloon,tenpo ni la sina tawa sike kon e ona

1004,and the air came slowly out,kon li kama weka tan ona lon tenpo suli

1005,and winniethepooh floated down to the ground,soweli wini pu li kama lon anpa

1006,but his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon all that time,taso luka ona li linja ala tan ni ona li awen e luka ona lon linja pi sike kon lon tenpo ale

1007,that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week,tan ni la luka ona li awen sinpin lon pini pi tenpo suno esun a

1008,and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off,pipi kon li kama anpa lon nena sinpin ona la tenpo ale la ona li wile weka e ona kepeken kon tan uta

1009,and i think  but i am not sure  that that is why he was always called pooh,tawa mi la  taso mi sona ala  tan ni la nimi ona li pu

1010,,

1011,is that the end of the story asked christopher robin,ni li pini toki li toki pi jan kitopa jopin

1012,that’s the end of that one,ni li pini pi wan ni

1013,there are others,taso wan ante li lon

1014,about pooh and me,pi ijo pi soweli pu en mi anu seme

1015,and piglet and rabbit and all of you,en soweli lili en soweli pi kute suli en sina ale

1016,don’t you remember,seme anu sina awen ala sona

1017,i do remember,mi awen sona

1018,and then when i try to remember i forget,taso mi lukin awen sona la mi pini sona

1019,that day when pooh and piglet tried to catch the heffalump ,tenpo suno ni soweli pu en soweli lili li wile alasa e soweli pi nena suli

1020,they didn’t catch it did they,ona tu li kama ala alasa e ona anu seme

1021,no,ala

1022,pooh couldn’t because he hasn’t any brain,soweli pu li ken ala tan ni ona li jo ala e lawa

1023,did i catch it,mi kama alasa e ona anu seme

1024,well that comes into the story,ni li wan toki

1025,christopher robin nodded,jan kitopa jopin li a kepeken lawa

1026,i do remember he said only pooh doesn’t very well,mi awen sona a  li toki ona  taso soweli pu li awen sona ala

1027,so that’s why he likes having it told to him again,tan ni la ona li wile e ni jan li toki e ona tawa ona lon tenpo sin

1028,because then it’s a real story and not just a remembering,tan ni kepeken ni la ni li toki lon li sona awen taso ala

1029,that’s just how i feel i said,tawa mi la ni li toki mi

1030,christopher robin gave a deep sigh picked his bear up by the leg and walked off to the door trailing pooh behind him,jan kitopa li a pi pilin ike li tan anpa e soweli ona pi luka wawa kepeken noka ona li tawa weka tawa lupa tomo li tawa e soweli pu lon anpa lon monsi ona

1031,at the door he turned and said coming to see me have my bath,lupa tomo la ona li tawa sike li toki e ni sina kama anu seme mi telo e mi

1032,i didn’t hurt him when i shot him did i,mi tan e kiwen utala tawa ona la mi pana ala e pilin ike tawa ona anu seme

1033,not a bit,ala

1034,he nodded and went out,ona li a kepeken lawa li tawa weka

1035,and in a moment i heard winniethepooh – bump bump bump – going up the stairs behind him,pini pi tenpo lili la mi kute e ni monsi ona la soweli wini pu li kalama pun pun pun li tawa sewi kepeken mute supa

1036,chapter ii,wan lipu nanpa tu

1037,in which pooh goes visiting and gets into a tight place,ona la soweli pu li tawa tomo pi jan ante li kama lon insa pi ijo lili

1038,edward bear known to his friends as winniethepooh or pooh for short was walking through the forest one day humming proudly to himself,soweli pi luka wawa etuwa  jan pona ona li sona e nimi ona wini pu anu pu taso  li tawa lon ma pi kasi suli lon tenpo suno wan li pilin suli li kalama musi kepeken uta pi open ala tawa ona sama

1039,he had made up a little hum that very morning as he was doing his stoutness exercises in front of the glass,ona li sitelen insa e kalama musi lon kama pi tenpo suno sama lon tenpo ni ona li pona e sijelo kepeken tawa lon sinpin lukin

1040,tralala tralala,talala talala

1041,as he stretched up as high as he could go,ona li sinpin e ona sama li suli pi mute ale e ona sama

1042,and then tralala tralaoh helpla,pini ni la talala tala  o pana e pona  la

1043,as he tried to reach his toes,ona li lukin luka e palisa noka

1044,after breakfast he had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by heart,kama pi tenpo suno la ona li moku pini ni la ona li toki e ni tawa ona sama lon tenpo mute mute li kama lon insa pi lawa ona e kalama musi

1045,and now he was humming it right through properly,tenpo ni la ona li kalama musi pi pakala ala e ale ona

1046,it went like this,ona li sama ni

1047,tralala tralala,talala talala

1048,tralala tralala,talala talala

1049,rumtumtiddleumtum,luntunsiteluntun

1050,tiddleiddle tiddleiddle,sitelite sitelite

1051,tiddleiddle tiddleiddle,sitelite sitelite

1052,rumtumtumtiddleum,luntuntunsitelun

1053,well he was humming this hum to himself and walking along gaily wondering what everybody else was doing,ona li kalama musi tawa ona sama li pilin pona li tawa lon nasin li wile sona e ni jan ale li pali seme

1054,and what it felt like being somebody else,jan li jan ante la ni li seme tawa pilin

1055,when suddenly he came to a sandy bank,tenpo ni la ona li kama lon sinpin pi ko kiwen

1056,and in the bank was a large hole,nena ni la lupa li lon

1057,aha said pooh,a a li nimi pi soweli pu

1058,rumtumtiddleumtum,luntunsiteluntun

1059,if i know anything about anything that hole means rabbit he said,mi sona e ijo ijo la kon pi lupa ni li soweli pi kute suli li toki ona

1060,and rabbit means company he said,kon pi soweli pi kute suli li jan poka li toki ona

1061,and company means food and listeningtomehumming and such like,kon pi jan poka li moku li kute tawa kalama musi mi li ni

1062,rumtumtumtiddleum,luntunsiteleluntun

1063,so he bent down put his head into the hole and called out,ni la ona li kama anpa li lon insa lupa e lawa li toki wawa

1064,is anybody at home,jan li lon tomo anu seme

1065,there was a sudden scuffling noise from inside the hole,tenpo lili la kalama li kama

1066,and then silence,pini ona la kalama ala li lon

1067,what i said was ‘is anybody at home’ called out pooh very loudly,mi toki e ni jan li lon tomo anu seme li toki pi wawa mute pi soweli pu

1068,no said a voice,ala li toki pi kalama uta

1069,and then added you needn’t shout so loud,ona li toki sin e ni sina wile ala toki pi kalama pi suli ni

1070,i heard you quite well the first time,mi kute pi pona a e sina lon tenpo nanpa wan

1071,bother said pooh,ike li toki pi soweli pu

1072,isn’t there anybody here at all,jan ala li lon anu seme

1073,nobody,jan ala

1074,winniethepooh took his head out of the hole and thought for a little and he thought to himself there must be somebody there because somebody must have said ‘nobody’,soweli wini pu li tan lupa e lawa li toki insa lon tenpo wan li toki tawa ona sama e ni sona li ni jan li lon tomo tan ni jan li toki e ni ‘jan ala’

1075,so he put his head back in the hole and said,ni la tenpo sin la ona li lon insa lupa e lawa li toki e ni

1076,hallo rabbit isn’t that you,toki soweli pi kute suli o seme anu ni li sina

1077,no said rabbit in a different sort of voice this time,ala li toki pi soweli pi kute suli kepeken kalama uta ante lon tenpo ni

1078,but isn’t that rabbit’s voice,taso seme anu ni li kalama uta pi soweli pi kute suli

1079,i don’t think so said rabbit,tawa mi la ala li toki pi soweli pi kute suli

1080,it isn’t meant to be,ni li wile ala

1081,oh said pooh,a li toki pi soweli pu

1082,he took his head out of the hole and had another think and then he put it back and said,ona li tan lupa e lawa li toki insa lon tenpo sin li lon sin e ona li toki e ni

1083,well could you very kindly tell me where rabbit is,sina ken toki e ni tawa mi anu seme soweli pi kute suli li lon seme

1084,he has gone to see his friend pooh bear who is a great friend of his,ona li tawa tomo pi soweli pi luka wawa pu ona li jan pi pona mute tawa ona

1085,but this is me said bear,taso ona li mi li toki pi soweli pi luka wawa

1086,very much surprised,ona li pilin pi sin nasa

1087,what sort of me,‘mi’ seme

1088,pooh bear,soweli pi luka wawa pu

1089,are you sure said rabbit,sina pilin sona anu seme li toki pi soweli pi kute suli

1090,still more surprised,ona li pilin pi sin pi nasa mute

1091,quite quite sure said pooh,mi pilin sona a a li toki pi soweli pu

1092,oh well then come in,a ni la o kama lon insa

1093,so pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole and at last he got in,ni la soweli pu li tawa kepeken noka en luka lon lupa nasin li kama lon insa lon pini pi tenpo suli

1094,you were quite right said rabbit,sina toki pona a li toki pi soweli pi kute suli

1095,looking at him all over,ona li lukin e ale ona

1096,it is you,ni la sina

1097,glad to see you,mi pilin pona tan ni

1098,who did you think it was,tawa sina la ni la jan seme

1099,well i wasn’t sure,mi pilin sona ala

1100,you know how it is in the forest,sina sona a e insa pi ma pi kasi suli

1101,one can’t have anybody coming into one’s house,jan li ken ala tawa insa tomo e jan mu

1102,one has to be careful,

1103,what about a mouthful of something,moku li pona anu seme

1104,pooh always liked a little something at eleven o’clock in the morning,tenpo ale la tawa soweli pu la moku lili lon pini pi kama pi tenpo suno li pona

1105,and he was very glad to see rabbit getting out the plates and mugs and when rabbit said honey or condensed milk with your bread,ona li pilin pi pona mute tan ni soweli pi kute suli li lon supa e poki li toki e ni ko suwi anu ko pi telo mama lon poka pi pan sina

1106,he was so excited that he said both,ona li pilin pi nasa wawa ni ona li toki sin e ni tu ale

1107,and then so as not to seem greedy he added but don’t bother about the bread please,ona li wile e ni ala ona li wile ike tan ni la ona li toki sin e ni sina ken awen weka e pan

1108,and for a long time after that he said nothing…,pini ni la tenpo suli la ona li toki ala…

1109,until at last humming to himself in a rather sticky voice he got up shook rabbit lovingly by the paw and said that he must be going on,pini ona la ona li kalama musi kepeken uta pi open ala tawa ona sama kepeken kalama uta ko a li kama sinpin li luka e luka pi soweli pi kute suli kepeken pilin li toki e ni ona li wile tawa

1110,must you said rabbit politely,sina wile anu seme li toki suwi pi soweli pi kute suli

1111,well said pooh i could stay a little longer if itif you,a  li toki pi soweli pu  mi ken awen lon tenpo sin lon ni…

1112,and he tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder,ona li lukin lukin tawa tomo pi poki moku

1113,as a matter of fact said rabbit i was going out myself directly,ni li lon  li toki pi soweli pi kute suli  mi sama li tawa weka

1114,oh well then i’ll be going on,a ni la mi tawa

1115,goodbye,mi tawa

1116,well goodbye if you’re sure you won’t have any more,a tawa pona lon ni sina pilin sona e ni sina wile ala e ijo sin

1117,is there any more asked pooh quickly,ijo sin li lon anu seme li toki pi soweli pu lon tenpo lili

1118,rabbit took the covers off the dishes and said no there wasn’t,soweli pi kute suli li weka e len tan poki moku li toki e ni ala lon ala

1119,i thought not said pooh,sama ni la tawa mi la ala li toki pi soweli pu

1120,nodding to himself,ona li a kepeken lawa tawa ona sama

1121,well goodbye,a mi tawa

1122,i must be going on,mi wile tawa

1123,so he started to climb out of the hole,ni la ona li kama tawa kepeken noka en luka tawa weka tan lupa

1124,he pulled with his front paws and pushed with his back paws,ona li lukin tan e ona sama kepeken luka li lukin tawa e ona kepeken noka

1125,and in a little while his nose was out in the open again…,pini pi tenpo lili la nena sinpin li kama…

1126,and then his ears…,kute li kama…

1127,and then his front paws…,luka li kama…

1128,and then his shoulders…,lawa sinpin li kama

1129,and then,ni la 

1130,oh help said pooh,o pana e pona li toki pi soweli pu

1131,i’d better go back,mi wile tawa monsi

1132,oh bother said pooh,a ike li toki pi soweli pu

1133,i shall have to go on,mi wile tawa sinpin

1134,i can’t do either said pooh,tu ale li ken ala li toki pi soweli pu

1135,oh help and bother,o pana e pona a ike

1136,now by this time rabbit wanted to go for a walk too,tenpo ni la sama ni la soweli pi kute suli li wile tawa weka

1137,and finding the front door full,taso ona li jo e lupa pi open ala

1138,he went out by the back door and came round to pooh and looked at him,tan ni la ona li tawa weka kepeken lupa pi monsi tomo li tawa lon poka sike tomo tawa soweli pu li lukin e ona

1139,hallo are you stuck he asked,toki sina lon insa ike anu seme li toki ona

1140,nno said pooh carelessly,aala li toki pi soweli pu kepeken pilin ala

1141,just resting,mi lape taso

1142,and thinking,mi toki insa taso

1143,and humming to myself,mi kalama musi taso kepeken uta pi open ala tawa mi sama

1144,here give us a paw,o o pana e luka

1145,pooh bear stretched out a paw,soweli pi luka wawa pu li lukin tawa weka e luka

1146,and rabbit pulled and pulled and pulled…,soweli pi kute suli li lukin tan e ona li lukin tan e ona li lukin tan e ona…

1147,ow cried pooh,a li toki wawa pi soweli pu

1148,you’re hurting,sina pana e pilin ike

1149,the fact is said rabbit,ni li lon li toki pi soweli pi kute suli

1150,you’re stuck,sina lon insa ike

1151,it all comes said pooh crossly of not having front doors big enough,ale ni li kama  li toki pi soweli pu kepeken pilin utala  tan ni jan li jo ala e lupa pi sinpin tomo pi suli pona

1152,it all comes said rabbit sternly of eating too much,ale ni li kama  li toki kiwen pi soweli pi kute suli  tan ni jan li moku ike

1153,i thought at the time said rabbit only i didn’t like to say anything said rabbit that one of us was eating too much said rabbit,tenpo la mi toki insa taso mi wile ala toki kalama e ni  li toki pi soweli pi kute suli  wan pi mi tu li moku ike li toki pi soweli pi kute suli

1154,and i knew if wasn’t me he said,mi sona e ni mi pali ala li toki ona

1155,well well i shall go and fetch christopher robin,ni ni mi tawa ni e jan kitopa jopin

1156,christopher robin lived at the other end of the forest,tomo pi jan kitopa jopin li lon poka ante pi ma pi kasi suli

1157,and when he came back with rabbit and saw the front half of pooh he said silly old bear in such a loving voice that everybody felt quite hopeful again,ona li tawa sin lon poka pi soweli pi kute suli li lukin e wan tu sinpin pi soweli pu la ona li toki e ni soweli nasa pi luka wawa o kepeken kalama uta pi suwi ni jan ale li pilin sin pi kama pona

1158,i was just beginning to think said bear sniffing slightly that rabbit might never be able to use his front door again,mi kama toki insa e ni  li toki pi soweli pi luka wawa kepeken kalama uta pi pilin ike  soweli pi kute suli li ken kepeken lupa tomo ona lon tenpo kama ala

1159,and i should hate that he said,ni li ike tawa mi

1160,so should i said rabbit,tawa mi a li toki pi soweli pi kute suli

1161,use his front door again said christopher robin,kepeken e lupa tomo ona li toki pi jan kitopa jopin

1162,of course he’ll use his front door again,ni li sona ona li kepeken lupa tomo ona lon tenpo sin

1163,good said rabbit,pona li toki pi soweli pi kute suli

1164,if we can’t pull you out pooh we might push you back,mi mute li ken ala tan e sina tawa weka soweli pu o ken la mi mute li wile tawa e sina tawa monsi

1165,rabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully and pointed out that when once pooh was pushed back he was back,jan soweli pi kute suli li toki insa li luka kiwen e linja uta li toki e ni jan li tawa monsi e soweli pu la ona li lon ni lon tenpo sin

1166,and of course nobody was more glad to see pooh than he was,sona li ni ona li pilin pi pona mute tan ni ona li lon poka pi soweli pu

1167,still there it was some lived in trees and some lived underground and,taso jan wan li jo e tomo lon kasi suli jan ante li jo e tomo lon anpa ma…

1168,you mean i’d never get out said pooh,sina toki e ni anu seme tenpo ala la mi ken tawa weka li toki pi soweli pu

1169,i mean said rabbit that having got so far it seems a pity to waste it,mi toki e ni mute li kama tawa mi la ona li kama weka ike la ni li pana e pilin ike

1170,christopher robin nodded,jan kitopa jopin li a kepeken lawa

1171,then there’s only one thing to be done he said,ni la ken li wan taso li toki ona

1172,we shall have to wait for you to get thin again,mi mute o awen lon tenpo ni sina kama suli ala lon tenpo sin

1173,how long does getting thin take asked pooh anxiously,tenpo ni jan li kama suli ala li suli anu seme li toki pi soweli pu pi pilin akesi

1174,about a week i should think,tawa mi la ni li sama tenpo suno esun

1175,but i can’t stay here for a week,taso mi ken ala awen lon ni lon ale pi tenpo suno esun

1176,you can stay here all right silly old bear,sina ken a awen lon ni soweli nasa pi luka wawa o

1177,it’s getting you out which is so difficult,ni taso li ike pali sina li kama tan

1178,we’ll read to you said rabbit cheerfully,mi mute li ken lukin e sitelen tawa sina li toki pi soweli pi kute suli kepeken pilin pona

1179,and i hope it won’t snow he added,kama pi ken ni taso li pona tawa mi telo ko kiwen li kama anpa ala li toki sin ona

1180,and i say old fellow you’re taking up a good deal of room in my house,mi toki e ni jan pona o sina lon insa mute pi tomo mi

1181,do you mind if i use your back legs as a towelhorse because i mean there they aredoing nothingand it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them,ni li pona tawa sina anu seme mi kepeken e noka sina sama ilo kili tan ni tawa mi la ona li pali ala jan li ken kili e len lon supa ona la ni li pana e pona pali

1182,a week said pooh gloomily,tenpo suno esun a li toki pi soweli pu pi pilin ike

1183,what about meals,ijo moku li seme

1184,i’m afraid no meals said christopher robin,mi pilin ike tan ni moku li lon ala li toki pi jan kitopa jopin

1185,because of getting thin quicker,ni pona pali e ni sina ken kama sin suli ala

1186,but we will read to you,taso mi mute li ken lukin e sitelen tawa sina

1187,bear began to sigh and then found he couldn’t because he was so tightly stuck,soweli pi luka wawa li kama a pi pilin ike li kama lukin e ni ona li ken ala tan ni ona li lon insa pi lili ike ni

1188,and a tear rolled down his eye,wan telo li kama anpa tan lukin ona

1189,as he said,ona li toki e ni

1190,then would you read a sustaining book such as would help and comfort a wedged bear in great tightness,ni la sina ken lukin e sitelen pi lipu ona li pana e wawa anu seme li pana e pona e pilin pona tawa soweli pi luka wawa lon insa ike

1191,so for a week christopher robin read that sort of book at the north end of pooh and rabbit hung his washing on the south end … and in between bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer,ni la ale pi tenpo suno esun la jan kitopa jopin li lukin e sitelen pi lipu ni lon poka pi suno ala soweli pi kute suli li kili e len telo lon poka suno

1192,and at the end of the week christopher robin said now,pini pi tenpo suno esun la jan kitopa jopin li toki e ni o

1193,so he took hold of pooh’s front paws,ni la ona li kama awen e luka pi soweli pu

1194,and rabbit took hold of christopher robin,sin ni la soweli pi kute suli li kama awen e jan kitopa jopin

1195,and all rabbit’s friends and relations took hold of rabbit,sin la jan pona ale pi soweli pi kute suli en jan sama li kama awen e soweli pi kute suli

1196,and they all pulled together…,jan ale li lukin tan e soweli pu…

1197,and for a long time pooh only said ow …,tenpo suli la soweli pu li toki e ni taso ike …

1198,and oh …,e ni o …

1199,and then all of a sudden he said pop,ni la lon tenpo lili la ona li toki e ni po

1200,just as if a cork were coming out of a bottle,ni li sama ilo len ona li kama tan lupa poki

1201,and christopher robin and rabbit and all rabbit’s friends and relations went headoverheels backwards…,jan kitopa jopin en soweli pi kute suli en jan pona ale ona en jan sama ale ona li tawa sike tawa monsi…

1202,and on the top of them came winniethepoohfree,supa ona la soweli wini pu li kama  taso

1203,so with a nod of thanks to his friends he went on with his walk through the forest humming proudly to himself,ni la ona li a kepeken lawa tawa jan pona mute li awen sin tawa lon ma pi kasi suli li kalama musi kepeken uta pi open ala tawa ona sama

1204,but christopher robin looked after him lovingly and said to himself silly old bear,taso jan kitopa jopin li lukin e monsi tawa ona kepeken pilin olin li toki tawa ona sama e ni soweli nasa pi luka wawa o

1205,chapter iii,wan lipu nanpa mute

1206,in which pooh and piglet go hunting and nearly catch a woozle,ona la soweli pu en soweli lili li alasa li alasa pi lili ike e soweli pi kiwen uta wawa

1207,the piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of a beechtree,soweli lili li jo e tomo pi suli mute lon insa pi kasi suli

1208,and the beechtree was in the middle of the forest,kasi suli ni li lon insa pi ma pi kasi suli

1209,and the piglet lived in the middle of the house,soweli lili li jo e tomo lon insa pi tomo ni

1210,next to his house was a piece of broken board which had,poka pi tomo ona la lipu suli li lon

1211,trespassers w on it,ona li jo e sitelen jan pi tawa akesi w

1212,when christopher robin asked the piglet what it meant he said it was his grandfather’s name and had been in the family for a long time,jan kitopa jopin li wile sona tan soweli lili e kon ona la ona li toki e ni ni li nimi pi mama mama li ijo pi kulupu mama tan kama pi tenpo suli

1213,christopher robin said you couldn’t be called trespassers w,jan kitopa jopin li toki e ni jan li ken ala jo e nimi jan pi tawa akesi w

1214,and piglet said yes you could because his grandfather was,soweli lili li toki e ni jan li ken jo tan ni mama mama ona li jo

1215,and it was short for trespassers will,ale pi nimi ni li jan pi tawa akesi wi

1216,which was short for trespassers william,ale pi nimi ni li ni jan pi tawa akesi wilijen

1217,and his grandfather had had two names in case he lost onetrespassers after an uncle and william after trespassers,mama mama ona li jo e nimi tu tan ken pi ike kama ni ona li pini jo e wan ona jan pi tawa ike lon pini pi mama sama wilijen lon pini pi jan pi tawa ike

1218,i’ve got two names said christopher robin carelessly,mi jo e nimi tu li toki pi jan kitopa jopin kepeken pilin ala

1219,well there you are that proves it said piglet,ni ni li pana e pilin sona li toki pi soweli lili

1220,one fine winter’s day when piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house he happened to look up,tenpo suno pi tenpo lete pi pona lukin la soweli pi palisa monsi sike li weka e ko lete tan sinpin pi lupa tomo ona la tan ken la ona li lukin e sewi

1221,and there was winniethepooh,ni la soweli wini pu li lon

1222,pooh was walking round and round in a circle thinking of something else,soweli pu li tawa lon poka sike li tawa lon poka sike li toki insa e ijo pi ijo ante

1223,and when piglet called to him he just went on walking,soweli pi palisa monsi sike li toki wawa tawa ona la ona li awen tawa a

1224,hallo said piglet,toki li toki pi soweli lili

1225,what are you doing,sina pali seme

1226,hunting said pooh,mi alasa li toki pi soweli pu

1227,hunting what,sina alasa e seme li toki pi soweli pu

1228,tracking something said winniethepooh very mysteriously,mi lukin e sitelen noka ijo li toki pi soweli wini pu tan weka sona nasa

1229,tracking what said piglet,sina lukin e sitelen noka seme li toki pi soweli lili

1230,coming closer,ona li tawa poka

1231,that’s just what i ask myself,mi toki e ni a tawa mi

1232,i ask myself what,mi toki e ni tawa mi seme

1233,what do you think you’ll answer,tawa sina la sina toki sin e seme

1234,i shall have to wait,mi wile awen

1235,until i catch up with it said winniethepooh,mi pini kama e ni mi alasa e ona li toki pi soweli wini pu

1236,now look there,o lukin e ni

1237,he pointed to the ground in front of him,ona li palisa e anpa lon sinpin

1238,what do you see there,sina lukin e seme

1239,tracks said piglet pawmarks,sitelen noka li toki pi soweli lili

1240,he gave a little squeak of excitement,ona li kalama lili kepeken uta lili tan pilin pi nasa wawa

1241,oh pooh,soweli pu o

1242,do you think it’s aaa woozle,tawa sina la ni li … ni li … ni li soweli pi kiwen uta wawa anu seme

1243,it may be said pooh,ken la ni li toki pi soweli pu

1244,sometimes it is,tenpo wan la ni

1245,and sometimes it isn’t,tenpo ante la ala

1246,you never can tell with pawmarks,tenpo ala la jan li ken kama sona e ijo pi sitelen noka

1247,with these few words he went on tracking,pini pi nimi ni pi mute ala la ona li awen lukin e sitelen noka

1248,and piglet after watching him for a minute or two ran after him,soweli lili li lukin e ona lon tenpo pi mute wan li tawa wawa tawa monsi ona

1249,winniethepooh had come to a sudden stop and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way,soweli wini pu li pini tawa lon tenpo lili li kama anpa lon sewi pi sitelen noka li pilin pi weka sona nasa

1250,what’s the matter asked piglet,seme li lon li toki pi soweli lili

1251,it’s a very funny thing said bear,ni li ijo nasa li toki pi soweli pi luka wawa

1252,but there seem to be two animals now,taso tawa mi la tenpo ni la soweli tu li lon

1253,thiswhateveritwashas been joined by anotherwhateveritis,soweli mu ni li kama lon poka pi soweli mu ante

1254,and the two of them are now proceeding in company,soweli tu ni li awen tawa lon poka kulupu

1255,would you mind coming with me piglet in case they turn out to be hostile animals,tawa sina la ni li pona anu seme sina tawa lon poka mi  soweli lili o  tan ken ni pi ike kama ona tu li utala

1256,piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way and said that he had nothing to do until friday and would be delighted to come in case it really was a woozle,soweli lili li luka kiwen e kute li suwi lukin li toki e ni ona li pali ala lon tenpo suno esun ni li wile kama tan ken ni ni li lon li soweli pi kiwen uta wawa

1257,you mean in case it really is two woozles said winniethepooh,sina wile toki e ni ni li soweli tu pi kiwen uta wawa li toki pi soweli wini pu

1258,and piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until friday,soweli lili li toki e ni taso ona li pali ala lon tenpo suno esun ni

1259,so off they went together,ni la ona tu li tawa lon poka kulupu

1260,there was a small spinney of larch trees just here,mute lili pi kasi suli anpa li lon ni

1261,and it seemed as if the two woozles if that is what they were had been going round this spinney,tawa lukin la soweli tu pi kiwen uta wawa  ona tu li ni la  li tawa lon poka sike pi mute ni pi kasi suli moli

1262,so round this spinney went pooh and piglet after them,sama ni la soweli pu en soweli lili pi palisa monsi sike li tawa lon poka sike pi mute ni pi kasi suli moli lon monsi pi ona tu

1263,piglet passing the time by telling pooh what his grandfather trespassers w had done to remove stiffness after tracking,soweli pi palisa monsi sike li musi li toki e ni tawa soweli pu mama mama pi tawa akesi w li pini lukin e sitelen noka la ona li wile weka e kiwen tan noka la ona li pali ona

1264,and how his grandfather trespassers w had suffered in his later years from shortness of breath,sin la ona li toki e ni sike suno pini ona la mama mama pi tawa akesi w li pilin ike tan weka kon

1265,and other matters of interest,sin la ona li toki e ijo ante pi pona sona

1266,and pooh wondering what a grandfather was like,soweli pu li pilin pi weka sona ni mama mama li seme

1267,and if perhaps this was two grandfathers they were after now,ken la ona tu li alasa e mama mama tu anu seme

1268,and if so whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it,ni la ona li ken tawa tomo e wan ona li ken awen e ona anu seme

1269,and what christopher robin would say,jan kitopa jopin li toki e seme pi ijo ni

1270,and still the tracks went on in front of them…,sin la sitelen noka li awen lon sinpin ona…

1271,suddenly winniethepooh stopped and pointed excitedly in front of him,tenpo lili la soweli wini pu li pini tawa li pilin pi nasa wawa li palisa e sinpin

1272,look,o lukin

1273,what said piglet with a jump,e seme li toki pi soweli lili li noka e anpa li tawa sewi

1274,and then to show that he hadn’t been frightened,ona li wile sama ni ona li pilin akesi ala

1275,he jumped up and down once or twice more,tan ni la ona li noka e anpa li tawa sewi lon tenpo pi wan anu tu

1276,in an exercising sort of way,kepeken ni la ona li sama pona e sijelo kepeken tawa

1277,the tracks said pooh,sitelen noka a li toki pi soweli pu

1278,a third animal has joined the other two,soweli nanpa mute li kama lon poka pi tu ante

1279,pooh cried piglet,soweli pu o li toki wawa pi soweli lili

1280,do you think it is another woozle,tawa sina la ni li soweli pi kiwen uta wawa ante

1281,no said pooh,ala li toki pi soweli pu

1282,because it makes different marks,tan ni ona li lon e sitelen ante

1283,it is either two woozles and one as it might be wizzle,ken wan la ni li soweli tu pi kiwen uta wawa en soweli lili wan pi kiwen uta wawa

1284,or two as it might be wizzles and one if so it is woozle,ken ante la ni li soweli lili tu pi kiwen uta wawa en soweli suli wan pi kiwen uta

1285,let us continue to follow them,mi o awen tawa lon monsi ona

1286,so they went on feeling just a little anxious now in case the three animals in front of them were of hostile intent,ni la ona tu li awen tawa li pilin lili pi ken ike ni soweli lon sinpin ona li utala

1287,and piglet wished very much that his grandfather t w were there instead of elsewhere,soweli lili li wile mute e ni mama mama t w li lon ni li lon ijo ante ala

1288,and pooh thought how nice it would be if they met christopher robin suddenly but quite accidentally and only because he liked christopher robin so much,soweli pu li toki insa e ni ona li kama lon poka pi jan kitopa jopin lon tenpo lili tan ken pi lili ale tan ni taso tawa ona la jan kitopa jopin li pona mute

1289,and then all of a sudden winniethepooh stopped again and licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner for he was feeling more hot and anxious than ever in his life before,ni la tenpo lili la soweli wini pu li pini tawa lon tenpo sin li pana e lete li uta e nena pi sinpin lawa kepeken palisa uta tan ni ona li pilin seli en akesi pi mute nanpa wan

1290,there were four animals in front of them,soweli tu tu li lon sinpin ona tu

1291,do you see piglet,sina lukin e ni anu seme

1292,look at their tracks,o lukin e sitelen noka ona

1293,three as it were woozles and one as it was wizzle,soweli mute pi kiwen uta wawa en soweli lili pi kiwen uta wawa

1294,another woozle has joined them,soweli pi kiwen uta wawa li kama lon poka ona

1295,and so it seemed to be,tawa jan la ni li lon

1296,there were the tracks,sitelen noka li lon

1297,crossing over each other here getting muddled up with each other there,ona li kama lon poka ante lon ni wan li kama wan nasa lon ni ante

1298,but quite plainly every now and then the tracks of four sets of paws,taso jan li ken lukin pona e ni lon tenpo pi mute wan sitelen pi noka tu tu tu li lon

1299,i think said piglet when he had licked the tip of his nose too and found that it brought very little comfort i think that i have just remembered something,tawa mi la  li toki pi soweli lili lon tenpo ni ona sin li uta e nena pi sinpin lawa taso tawa ona la ni li pana e pilin pi pona lili  tawa mi la mi kama sin awen sona e ijo

1300,i have just remembered something that i forgot to do yesterday and shan’t be able to do tomorrow,mi kama sin awen sona e ijo mi pini sona e ona lon tenpo suno pini mi ken ala pali e ona lon tenpo suno kama

1301,so i suppose i really ought to go back,tan ni la mi wile tawa monsi

1302,and do it now,mi wile pali e ona lon tenpo ni

1303,we’ll do it this afternoon,mi tu li pali e ona lon pini pi tenpo suno ni

1304,and i’ll come with you said pooh,mi tawa lon poka sina li toki pi soweli pu

1305,it isn’t the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon said piglet quickly,jan li ken ala pali e ona ni lon pini pi tenpo suno li toki pi soweli lili lon tenpo lili

1306,it’s a very particular morning thing,ona li ijo wan pi kama pi tenpo suno

1307,that has to be done in the morning,jan li wile pali e ona lon kama pi tenpo suno

1308,and if possible between the hours of,jan li ken la ona o pali e ona lon 

1309,what would you say the time was,tawa sina la wan seme pi tenpo suno li lon

1310,about twelve said winniethepooh looking at the sun,poka pi insa pi tenpo suno li lon li toki pi soweli wini pu ona li lukin e suno

1311,between as i was saying the hours of twelve and twelve five,lon  ni li toki mi  insa pi tenpo suno

1312,so really dear old pooh if you’ll excuse mewhat’s that,tan ni la ni la jan pona pu o sina wile weka e ike mi la  seme li lon

1313,pooh looked up at the sky and then as he heard the whistle again he looked up into the branches of a big oaktree and then he saw a friend of his,soweli pu li lukin e sewi li kute e kalama kon uta lon tenpo sin la ona li lukin e sewi e palisa pi kasi suli li kama lukin e jan pona ona

1314,it’s christopher robin he said,ni li jan kitopa jopin li toki ona

1315,ah then you’ll be all right said piglet,a ni la sina pona li toki pi soweli lili

1316,you’ll be quite safe with him,sina pona lon poka ona

1317,goodbye,mi tawa

1318,and he trotted off home as quickly as he could very glad to be out of all danger again,ona li tawa weka tawa tomo li pilin pona tan ni ona li pilin pi pona mute tan ni oni li lon weka pi ken pi ike kama

1319,christopher robin came slowly down his tree,jan kitopa jopin li kama anpa tan kasi suli ona

1320,silly old bear he said,soweli nasa pi luka wawa o li toki ona

1321,what were you doing,sina pali e seme

1322,first you went round the spinney twice by yourself,tenpo nanpa wan la sina tawa lon poka sike pi mute pi kasi suli moli

1323,and then piglet ran after you,pini ni la soweli lili li tawa wawa tawa monsi sina

1324,and you went round again together,sina tu li tawa lon poka sike lon tenpo sin lon poka kulupu

1325,and then you were just going round a fourth time,sin la sina tu li tawa lon poka sike lon tenpo nanpa tu tu

1326,wait a moment said winniethepooh holding up his paw,o awen lili li toki pi soweli wini pu ona li sewi e luka

1327,he sat down and thought in the most thoughtful way he could think,ona li kama anpa lon supa li toki insa pi wawa mute

1328,then he fitted his paw into one of the tracks…,pini ni la ona li lon sitelen luka e luka

1329,and then he scratched his nose twice and stood up,pini ni la ona li luka kiwen e nena pi sinpin lawa lon tenpo tu li kama sinpin

1330,yes said winniethepooh,lon li toki pi soweli wini pu
