," ONCE upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess, to tea.",,"tenpo wan la, soweli Lenja li lon, li soweli alasa, li soweli pi kalama noka ala. ona li wile kama e soweli pona ona Lawawa lon tenpo pi telo seli kasi. soweli Lawawa li soweli tomo pi mu wawa."
,"Come in good time, my dear Duchess (said Ribby's letter), ""and we will have something so very very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish—a pie-dish with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And you shall eat it all! I will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!"" wrote Ribby.",,"toki sitelen ni li tan soweli Lenja, li tawa soweli Lawawa: ""soweli Lawawa o. mi wile e sina lon poka mi lon tenpo pona. mi tu li ken jo e moku pona. mi wan li pali e ni lon poki pi pan poki—lon poki ni pi selo sewi loje. a, sina kama moku e ni la, moku sina pi tenpo pini li pona sama ala! a, sina kama moku e ni! mi wan li kama moku e pan suwi lili taso, soweli pona Lawawa o!"""
,"Duchess read the letter and wrote answer:—""I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four. But it is very strange. I was just going to invite you to come here, to supper, my dear Ribby, to eat something most delicious.",,"soweli Lawawa li kama lukin e toki ni la, ona li toki sitelen kin: ""mi wile a kama lon poka pi tenpo ilo nanpa tu tu. nasa musi la, mi kama wile kin e sina lon poka mi lon tenpo ni, tawa tenpo moku pona kama, soweli pona mi Lenja o."""
,"I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby, wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added—""I hope it isn't mouse?""",,"ona li awen sitelen: ""mi kama lon tenpo pi toki mi taso, pona Lenja o."" pini sitelen, ona li pana sin—""wile mi la, moku ni li soweli ala pi lili mute."""
,"And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out ""isn't mouse"" and changed it to ""I hope it will be fine,"" and she gave her letter to the postman.",,"taso ni li toki pona ala tawa pilin ona la, ona li weka sitelen e ""soweli ala pi lili mute"", li ante e toki ni: ""wile mi la, moku ni li pona."" ona li pana e lipu pi sitelen ni tawa jan pi lipu tawa."
,"But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.",,"taso pilin insa ona li awen lon moku pi soweli Lenja la, ona li awen lukin e sitelen pi soweli Lenja."
,"I am dreadfully afraid it will be mouse! said Duchess to herself—""I really couldn't, couldn't eat mouse-pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is party. And my pie THE INVITATION",,"soweli Lawawa li toki insa: ""pilin mi li ike tan ken pi soweli lili mi ken ala moku e pan pi soweli lili. taso tenpo kulupu li wile e moku ni tan mi. kin la, mi pana e pan kin la, pan mi li <br><br>WILE KAMA"
," was going to be veal and ham. A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's.""",,"pan pi soweli mani suli. a, poki pi selo sewi loje kin! poki mi kin li ni; li sama poki pi soweli Lenja. poki ni tu li tan esun pi soweli Mamako."""
,"Duchess went into her larder, and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.",,"soweli Lawawa li tawa tomo ona pi awen moku, li kama jo e pan ona tan supa, li lukin e pan."
,"It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam—Oh I do wish I could eat my own pie, instead of a pie made of mouse!",,"ona li pini, li ken tawa poki pali seli. selo ona li kama kiwen pona; mi pana e pan lon insa pi kiwen poki selo tawa awen pi selo pan. mi lupa wan e insa selo tan kama pi kon seli—a, wile mi la, mi kama moku e pan mi, e pan ala pi soweli lili."
,"Duchess considered and considered and read Ribby's letter again—",,"soweli Lawawa li awen pilin insa, li awen pilin insa, li lukin sin e sitelen pi soweli Lenja—"
,"A pink and white pie-dish—and you shall eat it all. 'You' means me—then Ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself? A pink and white pie-dish! Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins. . . . Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?",,"""poki walo pi selo sewi loje—a, sina kama moku e ni! nimi 'sina' li mi—ni la, soweli Lenja li moku ala a e pan ona anu seme? poki walo pi selo sewi loje! ni la, soweli Lenja li tawa esun, li wile esun e pan suwi lili. . . . a, mi sona wawa! mi kepeken tenpo lili la, mi ken pana e pan mi a tawa poki seli pi soweli Lenja lon weka ona, anu seme!"
,"Duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness!",,"soweli Lawawa li pilin pona mute tan sona wawa ona ni!"
,"Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog could come—she popped her pie into the oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.",,"tenpo sama la, sitelen pi soweli Lawawa li kama tawa soweli Lenja. soweli Lenja li kama sona e kama pi soweli pona la—ona li pana e pan ona tawa poki seli. poki seli tu li lon; poki wan li lon sewi pi poki ante; nena ilo lo lon poki, taso nena ale ala li tawa pali ilo. nena li ken namako, li ken tawa ala. soweli Lenja li pana e pan tawa poki seli noka; lupa poki li wile e wawa lon open ona."
,"The top oven bakes too quickly, said Ribby to herself. ""It is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast—rather big mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog; infinitely superior company to Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.""",,"soweli Lenja li toki insa: ""a, poki sewi li seli e moku kepeken tenpo lili. ni li ike. pan mi li jo e ko pona tan soweli pi lili mute e ko tan soweli pi loje walo. mi pakala wan pona e ko. mi weka e kiwen ale lon ko tan ni: kiwen pi sijelo kala li kama awen lon insa uta pi soweli Lawawa la, ona li kama ken ala moku e kon lon tenpo kulupu pini. ona li moku mute kepeken tenpo lili—li uta suli e moku ona. taso ona li lili pona li pali suwi. pona ona li suli la, pona pi soweli sama Mamako li lili lon tenpo kulupu."""
,"Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. Then she went out with a pail to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.",,"soweli Lenja li pana e kiwen wawa tawa poki seli. ni la, ona li jo e poki telo suli, li tawa weka, li wile jo e telo tawa poki pi telo seli."
," Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put them straight; the hearth-rug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantel-piece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs.",,"pini ni la, ona li nasin e ijo tomo ale. tomo ni wan li tomo moku, li tomo musi kin. ona li tawa luka e len awen supa lon poka pi lupa tomo, li nasin pona e len lon supa; len ma pi poka seli li selo tan soweli pi kute suli. ona li weka e ko lili tan ilo tenpo, tan namako pi selo ilo, li weka len pona e supa moku e supa monsi."
,"THE VEAL AND HAM PIE",,"PAN PI SOWELI MANI"
,"Then she spread a very clean white table-cloth, and set out her best china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fire-place. The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the dinner-plates were white and blue.",,"tenpo ni la, ona li len walo pona e supa moku, li pana e poki telo pi kiwen pona suwi tawa ni, tan supa poki sinpin lon poka seli. poki telo pona ni li walo, li jo e sitelen kasi pi loje walo; kiwen supa moku li walo, li laso."
,"When Ribby had laid the table she took a pitcher and a blue and white dish, and went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.",,"soweli Lenja li pana e ale tawa supa moku la, ona li kama jo e poki pi awen telo, e kiwen supa moku suli. ona li tawa tomo ma, li wile e telo walo e ko jelo tan soweli mani."
,"When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable. Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.",,"ona li kama sin lon tomo la, ona li lukin lon insa pi poki noka; pan li pona awen tawa lukin. soweli Lenja li len e lawa e sewi sijelo kepeken len pi awen seli, li jo e poki jo, li tawa ma tomo. ona li wile esun e kasi pi telo seli, e suwi kiwen, e poki pi ko kili suwi."
,"And just at the same time, Duchess came out of her house, at the other end of the village.",,"tenpo sama ni la, soweli Lawawa li kama tan tomo ona lon poka ante pi ma tomo."
," Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.",,"soweli Lenja en soweli Lawawa li kama lon poka lon insa pi ma tomo. soweli Lawawa kin li jo e poki jo. poki jo ona li len awen. ona tu li tawa e lawa ona sama toki, taso ona li toki kalama ala tan tenpo musi kama ona."
,"As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight—she simply ran! Straight away to Ribby's house!",,"soweli Lawawa li kama lon ala lukin pi soweli Lenja la, ona li tawa wawa a! ona li tawa tomo pi soweli Lenja kepeken tenpo lili!"
," what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.",,"soweli Lenja li tawa esun, li esun e ijo pi wile ona. ona li toki pona tawa soweli sama ona Mamako la, ona li tawa weka."
,"Cousin Tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation—",,"soweli Mamako li toki ike lon pini toki—"
,"A little dog indeed! Just as if there were no CATS in Sawrey! And a pie for afternoon tea! The very idea! said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.",,"soweli Mamako li toki: ""soweli tomo pi mu wawa anu seme a! soweli pi kalama noka ala li lon ma tomo ni, anu seme! pan poki lon tenpo pi telo seli anu seme! ni anu seme!"""
,"Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins. Then she went home.",,"soweli Lenja li awen tawa jan Panu, li esun e pan suwi lili. ni la, ona li tawa tomo ona."
,"There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door.",,"ona li kama lon lupa pi tomo ona la, kalama nasa tawa li lon monsi nasin pi poka tomo."
,"I trust that is not that Pie: the spoons are locked up, however, said Ribby.",,"soweli Lenja li toki: ""pilin mi la, kalama ni li ken ala tan pan. kin la, ilo moku li awen lon poki. poki li pini awen."""
,"But there was nobody there. Ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty, and turned the pie. There began to be a pleasing smell of baked mouse!",,"taso jan ala li lon. soweli Lenja li open e lupa pi poki seli luka kepeken wawa wile, li tawa e poka pan tawa poka ante. ni li kama e kon pona tawa nena tan soweli seli pi lili mute!"
,"Duchess, in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.",,"tenpo lili ni la, soweli Lawawa li kama weka tan lupa pi monsi tomo lon ala sona pi soweli Lenja."
,"It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was not in the oven when I put mine in! And I can't find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house. I put my pie into a nice hot oven at the top. I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams, said Duchess, ""but I wish I could have removed the pie made of WHERE IS THE PIE MADE OF MOUSE?",,"soweli Lawawa li toki: ""mi pana e pan mi tawa poki seli la, pan pi soweli Lenja li lon ala poki. ni li nasa! mi alasa e pan ona lon ale tomo, mi kama ala lukin e pan ona; mi pana e pan mi tawa poki sewi pi seli pona. mi ken ala tawa e nena ante lon poki, e lupa ante lon poki; pilin mi la, ni ale li musi taso, li ilo ala. taso mi wile weka e pan ona pi<br><br>PAN PI SOWELI LILI LI LON SEME?"
," mouse! I cannot think what she has done with it! I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!""",,"soweli lili lon tenpo pini! soweli Lenja li pana e ona lon seme! mi kama kute e soweli Lenja la, mi ken tawa weka taso!"""
,"Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.",,"soweli Lawawa li tawa tomo ona, li pona nasin e linja pimeja pona ona; ni pini la, ona li tawa ma kasi lili ona, li kama jo pona e kasi suwi kule tawa soweli Lenja; ona li awen tawa tenpo ilo nanpa tu tu."
,"Ribby—having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder—went upstairs to change her dress.",,"soweli Lenja li awen alasa e tan kalama, li kama sona e lon pi jan ala lon supa poki ona anu tomo pi awen moku la—ona li tawa sewi tomo, li ante e len ona."
,"She put on a lilac silk gown for the party, and an embroidered muslin apron and tippet.",,"ona li jo e len pi loje walo pona e len awen walo pi selo namako e len lili pi sewi sijelo."
,"It is very strange, said Ribby, ""I did not think I left that drawer pulled out; has somebody been trying on my mittens?""",,"soweli Lenja li toki: ""ni li nasa. pilin mi la, mi open ala e poki ni. jan li kepeken ala kepeken len luka mi pi weka seli?"""
,"She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob. She peeped again into the bottom oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.",,"ona li kama sin lon anpa tomo, li pali e telo seli, li pana e poki pi telo seli tawa supa seli. ona li lukin sin e poki seli noka. kule pan li kama pona pi pimeja lili, li seli wawa a."
,"She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. ""I am glad I used the bottom oven,"" said Ribby, ""the top one would certainly have been very much too hot. I wonder why that cupboard door was open? Can there really have been some one in the house?""",,"ona li tawa ma anpa lon poka seli, li awen tawa kama pi soweli pona. ona li toki: ""a pona la mi kepeken poki noka. poki sewi li seli wawa ike tawa pan. a, taso lupa pi poki awen li open tan seme? jan li lon tomo lon tenpo pini anu seme?"""
,"READY FOR THE PARTY.",,"TENPO KULUPU LI KEN KAMA A."
," Very punctually at four o'clock Duchess started to go to the party. She ran so fast through the village that she was too early, and she had to wait a little while in the lane that leads down to Ribby's house.",,"tenpo pona la, soweli Lawawa li open e tawa tan tenpo musi. ona li tawa wawa lon ma tomo, li kama lon tomo pi soweli Lenja la, tenpo kulupu li lon tenpo kama a. ni la, ona li awen lon tenpo tan wile ona, li awen tawa tenpo pona lon nasin pi poka tomo."
,"I wonder if Ribby has taken my pie out of the oven yet? said Duchess, ""and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse?""",,"soweli Lawawa li toki insa: ""mi wile sona e ni: soweli Lenja li kama ala kama jo weka e pan mi tan poki seli? a, sama la, pan ante pi soweli lili li lon seme?"""
,"At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappitty.",,"tenpo pona la, kalama luka suwi li lon lupa."
,"Is Mrs. Ribston at home? inquired Duchess in the porch.",,"sinpin tomo la, soweli Lawawa li toki: ""soweli Lenja li lon ala lon?"""
,"Come in! and how do you do? my dear Duchess, cried Ribby. ""I hope I see you well?""",,"soweli Lenja li kalama: ""o kama! sina pilin seme, soweli Lawawa pona mi o? mi wile e ni: sina pilin pona!"""
,"Quite well, I thank you, and how do you do, my dear Ribby? said Duchess. ""I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!""",,"soweli Lawawa li toki: ""a, mi pilin pona. toki sina li pona tawa mi. sina pilin pona sama anu seme, soweli Lenja pona mi o? mi kama e kasi kute tawa sina; a, kon pan ni li pona tawa mi!"""
,"Oh, what lovely flowers! Yes, it is mouse and bacon!",,"""a! kasi kuli li suwi! lon a, kon pona li tan soweli seli pi lili mute, li tan soweli seli pi loje walo kin!"""
,"Do not talk about food, my dear Ribby, said Duchess; ""what a lovely white tea-cloth! . . . . Is it done to a turn? Is it still in the oven?""",,"soweli Lawawa li toki: ""a, o pini e toki moki, soweli pona Lenja o. a, len walo pi supa moku li pona suwi! . . . . sina ante e poka pan anu seme? ona li awen lon poki seli anu seme?"
,"I think it wants another five minutes, said Ribby. ""Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait. Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?""",,"soweli Lenja li toki: ""ona li wile awen lon seli lon tenpo lili awen. kule ona o kama pimeja lili kin; mi pana e telo seli tawa awen tenpo ni pi mi tu. sina wile ala wile e suwi lon telo, soweli pona Lawawa o?"""
,"DUCHESS IN THE PORCH.",,"SOWELI LAWAWA LON SINPIN TOMO."
," ""Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?""",,"""wila a, soweli Lenja o! mi ken ala ken jo e kiwen suwi wan lon nena mi kin?"""
,"With pleasure, my dear Duchess; how beautifully you beg! Oh, how sweetly pretty!",,"""mi ni la mi pilin pona, soweli Lawawa o; a, pali wile sina li suwi! a, pona suwi!"""
,"Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed—",,"soweli Lawawa li sewi lili, li awen e kiwen suwi lon nena ona, li pilin e kon—"
,"How good that pie smells! I do love veal and ham—I mean to say mouse and bacon——",,"""a, kon pan li pona a! soweli mani suli li moku pona—a, toki pakala, mi wile toki e ni: soweli pi lili mute en soweli pi loje walo li moku pona——"""
," She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea-table, so she did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.",,"nasa pi toki ni la, kiwen li kama anpa tan nena ona. ona li alasa e kiwen lon anpa supa la, ona li kama ala lukin e ni: soweli Lenja li open e poki seme tawa pan?"
,"Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savory smell.",,"soweli Lenja li pana e pan tawa supa moku; kon moku li kon pona."
,"Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.",,"soweli Lawawa li kama sewi sin, li moku e kiwen suwi, li kama awen lon supa monsi."
," ""I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade,"" said Ribby.",,"soweli Lenja li toki: ""open la, mi kama e pan poki lili tan pan poki suli tawa sina; mi jo e pan suwi lili e ko suwi tawa mi."""
,"Do you really prefer muffin? Mind the patty-pan!",,"""wile sina li wawa tawa pan suwi anu seme? a, o pakala ala lon kiwen poki pi selo pan!"""
,"I beg your pardon? said Ribby.",,"soweli Lenja li toki: ""seme?"""
,"May I pass you the marmalade? said Duchess hurriedly.",,"soweli Lawawa li toki wawa kepeken tenpo lili: ""mi o pana ala pana e ko suwi tawa sina a?"""
,"The pie proved extremely toothsome, and the muffins light and hot. They disappeared rapidly, especially the pie!",,"soweli Lawawa li moku e pan la, pan li pona mute lon uta. soweli Lenja li moku e pan suwi la, pan li wile a lon insa. pan tu li kama weka moku kepeken tenpo lili. pan poki li kama weka mute a."
,"I think—(thought Duchess to herself)—I think it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into! I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own.",,"soweli Lawawa li toki insa: ""mi wile e kama pona la, ken la, mi wan o weka pana e pan lili tan pan poki tawa mi; taso lukin la, soweli Lenja li kama ala sona e nasa tan pali pana pan. ijo pan insa li lili mute suwi a! lili pona ni li lon ala sona mi pi pali pan mi tan tenpo pini; a, ken la ni li tan wawa seli lon poki seli pi soweli Lenja, li wawa seli suli lon wawa lili pi poki seli mi."""
,"How fast Duchess is eating! thought Ribby to herself, as she buttered her fifth muffin.",,"soweli Lenja li ko jelo e pan suwi ona nanpa luka la, ona li toki insa: ""soweli Lawawa li moku kepeken tenpo lili a!"" "
,"The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four servings already, and was fumbling with the spoon.",,"poki pan li kama weka lon tenpo pi mute ala! soweli Lawawa li moku e pan lili tu tu kin, li pini, li tawa e ilo moku lon luka ona."
,"WHERE IS THE PATTY-PAN?",,"POKI PAN LI LON SEME?"
,"A little more bacon, my dear Duchess! said Ribby.",,"soweli Lenja li toki: ""sina wile e ko moku sin anu seme, soweli pona Lawawa o?"""
,"Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan.",,"""toki sina li pona, soweli pona Lenja o, taso mi alasa e kiwen poki pi selo pan."""
,"The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?",,"soweli Lawawa o. kiwen poki seme?"

,"Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to? said Duchess.",,"soweli Lawawa li toki: ""ona li lon kin, soweli Lenja o; taso ona li lon seme?"""
,"There most certainly is not one, my dear Duchess. I disapprove of tin articles in puddings and pies.

,"Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.",,"toki ni li suli e wawa pi pilin ike tawa soweli Lawawa. ni la, ona li awen tawa e ilo moku lon pan."
,"My Great-aunt Squintina (grandmother of Cousin Tabitha Twitchit)—died of a thimble in a Christmas plum-pudding.

,"It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan.",,"""ni li ken ala, soweli pona Lawawa o. kiwen poki li lon ala pan."""

,"How could I have swallowed it! such a large hard thing as a patty-pan!",,"""a mi kama moku e ona tan seme! kiwen poki selo li suli a!"""
,"She got up and went to the table, and felt inside the pie-dish again with a spoon.",,"ona li kama sewi, li tawa supa moku, li pilin sin e insa pan kepeken ilo moku."
,"No; there is no patty-pan, and I put one in; and nobody has eaten pie except me, so I must have swallowed it!",,"""ala a; kiwen li lon ala ni, taso mi pana e kiwen; jan ante ala li moku e pan. mi taso li ni. ni la, mi kama moku e kiwen!"""

,"Duchess started! She opened the door of the top oven;—out came a rich steamy flavor of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,—and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!",,"soweli Lawawa li tawa wawa! ona li tawa poki seli, li open e lupa pi poki sewi;—kon wawa seli li kama tan poki, li sama ko soweli seli tawa nena. pan pi pimeja pona li lon insa—lupa pi sewi pan la, kiwen poki li ken lon lukin!"

,"back-yard and say nothing about it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away."" She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.",,
,"Gammon, ha, HA! said the doctor.",,
,"I am feeling very much better, said Duchess, waking up with a jump.",,
,"I am truly glad to hear it! He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!",,
,"I think I should feel quite well if he only felt my pulse, said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.",,
,"'It is only a bread-pill, you had much better take it; drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!""",,
,"Gammon! Gammon! said the doctor, while Duchess coughed and choked.",,
,"Don't say that again! said Ribby, losing her temper—""Here, take this bread and jam, and get out into the yard!""",,
,"Gammon and Spinach! ha ha HA! shouted Dr. Maggotty triumphantly outside the back door. . . . . .",,
,"I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby, said Duchess. ""Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?""",,
,"Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess. I will lend you a nice warm shawl, and you shall take my arm.",,
,"SO THERE REALLY WAS A PATTY-PAN.",,
,"I would not trouble you for worlds; I feel wonderfully better. One pill of Dr. Maggotty——",,

,"Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home. Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door. Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.",,
,"Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws. The jackdaws were eating pie-crust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.",,

,"Duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly!",,
,"When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard. The patty-pan was under the pump, where Dr. Maggotty had considerately left it.",,
,"Ribby stared with amazement—""Did you ever see the like! so there really was a patty-pan? . . . . But my patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard. Well I never did! . . . . Next time I want to give a party—I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!""",,
