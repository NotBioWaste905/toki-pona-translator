,"They're a group of artists, citizens, and scientists... and they're doing everything they can.",,,
,"They're engineering a benign virus to infect people and deliver an antidote for the pills.",,,

,"And they're building a rich, deep community to support and foster this way of life.",,,
,"No tantric sex club, though.",,,
,"I'll admit, it was near-impossible finding them; they made sure of that.",,,
,"But nothing's impossible when you have enough time.",,,
,"And I definitely had enough of that.",,,
,"Here's what my schedule looked like this morning, in absolute-time:",,,
,"0600: wake up",,,
,"0700: learn programming",,,
,"0800: hack into my old workplace's servers & get Cliché Dystopia Corporation Incorporated's secret formula for their experimental 2,400-pill",,,
,"0900: learn biochemistry & neuropsychology",,,
,"1100: improve the formula, manufacture a 1,000,000-pill, and take it.",,,
,"1101: here goes nothing.",,,
,"1101: learn quantum physics",,,
,"1110: solve a few unsolved problems in quantum physics",,,
,"1122: build a quantum computer",,,
,"1126: use it to break the encryption on all internet communication",,,
,"1128: use it to break the encryption on all satellite communication",,,
,"1132: hijack a few private image-capturing satellites",,,
,"1140: learn computational neuroscience",,,
,"1145: create an AI to scan yottabytes of internet traffic & trillions of millimeter-resolution satellite images, to find Darren.",,,
,"1148: no photos of Darren found, but internet metadata showed Darren was in direct contact with Professor Harrington(!!!)",,,
,"1149: told AI to search for satellite images of Professor Harrington",,,
,"1151: Professor Harrington found in Canada!",,,
,"1152: hijack a weather drone to make a sky-written message to Professor Harrington, identifying myself as a friend of Darren's, and giving him my phone number.",,,
,"1153: Professor Harrington writes a message on a piece of cardboard explaining that he doesn't have a phone, and shows it to my drone.",,,
,"fuck's sake.",,,
,"we have a cardboard-drone conversation instead.",,,
,"That's when I learnt that Darren had volunteered to be the first human trial for their pill antidote.",,,
,"It worked, but had severe side effects.",,,
,"Darren died.",,,
,"But he did not die in vain.",,,
,"The autopsy let them pinpoint exactly the flaws in their antidote, they iterated on it, and their 2nd and 3rd human trials were a success.",,,
,"In the next few months (absolute-months, sadly), they'll be working on a way to deliver this antidote through a benign virus, in order to give it to everyone.",,,
,"In order to let humanity really take its time back.",,,
,"To unplug the treadmill.",,,
,"Professor Harrington invited me to come to Darren's funeral.",,,
,"I said yes.",,,
,"My tears were floating around me, falling at 0.002% speed.",,,
,"You know what, I needed a break.",,,
,"A sabbatical, if you will.",,,
,"So, I decided to learn every language.",,,
,"Invented a couple of my own while I was at it.",,,
,"Took up rice-grain sculpture for a couple relative-months.",,,
,"Watched every film.",,,
,"Played every videogame.",,,
,"Read every book.",,,
,"And you know what? Of all the books I read, I hated the dystopian novels the most.",,,
,"Coz here's the two biggest bullshit things about 'em:",,,
,"One -- in most dystopia stories, some horrible thing is forced upon the public.",,,
,"Big Brother or bumblepuppies or whatever.",,,
,Bullshit.,,,
,"When the thing that will destroy humanity comes, it will be made with the best intentions, and we'll all buy into it willingly.",,,
,"Nobody forced us on this treadmill.",,,
,"It's just us.",,,
,"But, two -- in dystopia stories, the protagonist usually caves in.",,,
,"Guy says 2+2=5 or hangs himself in a tower, spoiler alert.",,,
,"And yeah sure, I'm not naive, good people lose all the time, but if you're writing a dystopian story to help us avoid that future, why depress your audience, killing their motivation to actually do something about it? ",,,
,"Coz, yeah, 1984 was so fucking influential, it stopped governments and corporations from spying on people, ever.",,,
,"Uh huh.",,,
,"But I'm not going to cave in.",,,
,"All those relative-decades ago, I made a promise.",,,
,"I promised my friend, my only friend:",,,
,"I wouldn't give in.",,,
,"Should probably tie up some loose plot threads here.",,,
,"Harrington gave me the instructions for traveling to his community, plus the formula for the antidote.",,,
,"I manufactured the antidote, and brought myself down to a 1000-pill level.",,,
,"I still needed to be fast enough to make my way through traffic and get to the airport.",,,
,"But first, I stopped by Darren's former house.",,,
,"His poor family.",,,
,"They've refused to take the TYT pill all this time, and now they're moving at 2% the speed of everyone else.",,,
,"I saw Darren's wife bending over -- in slow motion -- to pick up a bag of groceries her neighbors left her, since she can't possibly go to the grocery store herself.",,,
,"While she was busy blinking, I put a note in her bag explaining Darren's heroic sacrifice.",,,
,"She deserved to know.",,,
,"Afterwards, I stopped by my old workplace and flipped them the bird.",,,
,"Two birds, in fact.",,,
,"Then, I went to Starbucks, and told Sam he's a good kid, but as much as I appreciate the flirtatious attention he's been giving an old woman like me, he should be dating other girls and/or boys his age, and I wished him well in life, and that I'll have a tall green tea latte.",,,
,Hm.,,,
,"My flight to Canada doesn't leave for another couple relative-hours.",,,
,"I still have time to kill.",,,
,"No, not kill.",,,
,"Time to live.",,,
,"That's when I saw it: a monarch butterfly.",,,
,"It seemed to be moving so, so slowly: 2% of its normal speed, to be exact.",,,
,"I always thought butterfly wings simply flapped up and down.",,,
,"But in super slow-motion, I could see that their wings actually twist and turn, in a kind of ""figure 8"" motion.",,,
,"An infinity sign, in every flap.",,,
,"It was delicately hovering over a flower bed outside the Starbucks, trying to find the perfect flower to feast upon.",,,
,"And I whispered: Take your time, little buddy.",,,
,"Take your time.",,,
