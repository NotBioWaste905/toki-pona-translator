Text start,CECILY PARSLEY'S NURSERY RHYMES,
,"CECILY PARSLEY lived in a pen,",
,And brewed good ale for gentlemen;,
,"GENTLEMEN came every day,",
,Till Cecily Parsley ran away.,
,"GOOSEY, goosey, gander,",
,Whither will you wander?,
,"Upstairs and downstairs,",
,⁠And in my lady's chamber!,
,THIS pig went to market;,
,⁠This pig stayed at home;,
,THIS pig had a bit of meat;,
,AND this pig had none;,
,THIS little pig cried,
,⁠Wee! wee! wee!,
,I can't find my way home.,
,PUSSY-CAT sits by the fire;,
,⁠How should she be fair?,
,"In walks the little dog,",
,"⁠Says ""Pussy! are you there?""",
,"HOW do you do, Mistress Pussy?",
,"⁠Mistress Pussy, how do you do?""",
,"I thank you kindly, little dog, ⁠I fare as well as you!",
,"THREE blind mice, three blind mice,",
,⁠See how they run!,
,"They all run after the farmer's wife,",
,"And she cut off their tails with a carving knife,",
,Did you ever see such a thing in your life,
,⁠As three blind mice!,
,"BOW, wow, wow!",
,⁠Whose dog art thou?,
,"I'm little Tom Tinker's dog, ⁠Bow, wow, wow!",
,"WE have a little garden,",
,"⁠A garden of our own,",
,And every day we water there,
,⁠The seeds that we have sown.,
,"WE love our little garden,",
,"⁠And tend it with such care,",
,You will not find a faded leaf,
,⁠Or blighted blossom there.,
,"NINNY NANNY NETTICOAT,",
,"In a white petticoat,",
,"⁠With a red nose,—",
,"The longer she stands,",
,⁠The shorter she grows.,
