,"ONCE upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's-house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney.",,"tenpo wan la, tomo pi pona mute li lon. ona li tawa jan ala, li sama tomo jan. ona li lili, li tawa ijo. sinpin ona li loje. selo lupa li walo. len walo pona li lon lupa, li len lon a. lupa tawa kin li lon. sewi tomo la, lupa li ken pana e kon."
,"IT belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals.",,"ijo musi suwi tu li lawa e tomo. ona li ijo Ipiki, li ijo Jante. ona li sama jan tawa lukin. lon la, ijo Ipiki taso li lawa, taso ona li wile ala e pali moku tan ijo Jante."
,"Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings.",,"ijo Jante li jan pi pali moku; taso ona li pali e moku lon tenpo ala tan ni: moku ale li lon a, li wile ala e pali moku, li pini. esun la, moku li awen lon poki lon ko awen."
,"THERE were two red lobsters and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges.",,"kala pipi loje tu en ko soweli moku en kala laso en ko suwi en kili mute li lon."
,"They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.",,"ona li awen, li ken ala weka tan supa ona, taso ona li pona mute tawa lukin."
,"ONE morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator. There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet. Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.",,"tenpo suno wan li open la, ijo Ipiki en ijo Jante li tawa weka lon poki tawa ona. jan ala li lon tomo pi jan lili la, kalama ala li lon a. a, taso kalama lili li kama, li tan luka lili anu noka lili, li lon poka pi pki seli. lupa li lon noka sinpin."
,"Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again.",,"soweli Lukan li tawa e lawa ona lon lupa, li weka sin e ni."
,"Tom Thumb was a mouse.",,"soweli Lukan li soweli pi lili mute. kute ona li sike. monsi ona la linja palisa suli li lon. kiwen uta sinpin tu li palisa."
,"AMINUTE afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.",,"soweli Lukante li meli ona, li tawa kin e lawa ona lin lupa. ona li lukin e jan ante lon tomo ni la, ona li tawa, lon len ma supa."
,"THE doll's-house stood at the other side of the fire-place. Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug. They pushed the front door—it was not fast.",,"tomo lili ijo li lon poka ante pi poki seli. soweli Lukan en soweli Lukante li tawa ona kepeken nasin pi lukin mute. ona li luka e lupa tawa—lupa li awen ala, li open."
,"TOM THUMB and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room. Then they squeaked with joy!",,"soweli Lukan en soweli Lukante li tawa sewi pi tomo lili, li lukin e tomo moku. ni la, ona li mu pi pilin pona wawa!"
,"Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs—all so convenient!",,"moku pona a li lon supa moku! ilo moku li lon—supa monsi tu kin li lon, li suli pona a!"
,"TOM THUMB set to work at once to carve the ham. It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red.",,"soweli Lukan li wile pali lon ko soweli moku. ona li pona tawa lukin, li jelo suno, li loje lili linja kin."
,"The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.",,"ilo li kama pakala lon luka ona, li utala e luka. pilin pakala la, ona li uta pona e luka."
,"It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca.",,"""ni li kama ala seli pona lon tenpo pini la, ni li kiwen mute. soweli Lukante o lukin pali."""
,"HUNCA MUNCA stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.",,"soweli Lukante li sewi tan supa monsi ona, li lukin utala kin e ko kepeken ilo."
,"It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's, said Hunca Munca. THE ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.",,"soweli Lukante li toki: ""moku soweli ni li kiwen a sama moku soweli lon jan pi ko moku pona."" moku en supa lili ona li kama tu pakala. moku li tawa anpa kepeken wawa, li lawa anpa pi supa moku."
,"Let it alone, said Tom Thumb; ""give me some fish, Hunca Munca!""",,"soweli Lukan li toki: ""o tawa ala ona. o pana e kala, soweli Lukante o!"""
,"HUNCA MUNCA tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.",,"soweli Lukante li kepeken ilo moku ale, taso kala li awen lon supa lili ona."
,"Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel—bang, bang, smash, smash!",,"ni la, soweli Lukan li kama pilin utala. ona li pana e moku soweli lon ma, li kepeken ilo suli moku, li kepeken ilo pali ante—li utala, Utala, Utala, Utala, Utala!"
,"The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!",,"moku soweli li pakala mute tan ni: selo kule ona li weka la insa ona li kiwen ko taso!"
,"THEN there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca. They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges.",,"ni li suli e pilin utala pi soweli tu, e pilin anpa ona. ona li pakala e ko suwi, e kala pipi loje, e kili ale."
,"As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.",,"kala laso li ken ala weka tan supa lili ona la, soweli li pana wawa e kala tawa poki seli pi lipu loje; taso kala li kama ala seli."
,"TOM THUMB went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top—there was no soot.",,"soweli Lukan li tawa sewi tomo, li lukin e lupa pi pana kon—pimeja pi seli pini li lon ala."
,"WHILE Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment. She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labelled—Rice—Coffee—Sago—but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.",,"soweli Lukan li lon sewi la, ike ante li kama tawa soweli Lukante. sewi pi supa poki la, ona li lukin e poki lili a. nimi li lon poki, li toki e pan—e namako wawa pi telo pimeja—e kili lili—taso ona li anpa e sewi poki la, kiwen laso taso en kiwen loje taso li kama tan poki."
,"THEN those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could—especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window.",,"ni ale la, soweli ni tu li kama pali e ike ale tan wile ona—soweli Lukan li pali mute kin e ike! ona li weka e len pona pi ijo Jante tan poki len lon tomo lape, li tawa e ni tan lupa lukin lon sewi tomo."
,"But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed.",,"taso soweli Lukante li pilin wile. ona li weka e len waso mute tan supa lape pi ije Ipiki la, sona li kama sin lon ona: ona li wile e supa lape pona pi len waso insa."
,"WITH Tom Thumb's assistance she carried the bolster downstairs, and across the hearth-rug. It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-hole; but they managed it somehow.",,"soweli Lukan li pana kin e pali la, ona li tawa e supa len lape, li tawa anpa tomo, li tawa weka pi tomo lili, li tawa lon len ma supa, li tawa lupa lon sinpin. ona li wile insa e supa len la ona li kepeken pali mute, li kepeken wawa mute; taso ona li kama pali e ni a."
,"THEN Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a book-case, a bird-cage, and several small odds and ends. The book-case and the bird-cage refused to go into the mouse-hole.",,"sin la, soweli Lukante li tawa tomo, li jo e supa monsi, e supa pi lipu mute, e poki pi jo waso, e ijo ante mute. taso supa lipu en poki waso li ken ala tawa insa pi lupa soweli."
,"HUNCA MUNCA left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.",,"soweli Lukante li poka e ni tu lon poki pi kiwen seli, li alasa e supa pi jan lili sin."
,"HUNCA MUNCA was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.",,"soweli Lukante li kama e supa monsi ante la, kalama toki li kama tan weka tomo. soweli li tawa wawa lon lupa. ijo musi jan li kama lon tomo pi jan lili."
,"WHAT a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!",,"ijo Jante en ijo Ipiki li lukin e ale ni a!"
,"Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled—but neither of them made any remark.",,"ijo Ipiki li kama awen lon supa pi seli moku, li lukin taso; ijo Jante li kama poka lon poki pi ilo moku. sinpin ona li awen sama. taso ona tu li toki ala."
,"THE book-case and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal-box—but Hunca Munca has got the cradle, and some of Lucinda's clothes.",,"ona li kama ken awen e supa lipu e poki waso tan poki pi kiwen seli—taso soweli Lukante li jo e supa pi jan lili sin e len mute kin pi ijo Ipiki."
,"SHE also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.",,"ona li jo e poki pona kin e ilo poki moku kin e ijo ante kin."
,"THE little girl that the doll's-house belonged to, said,—""I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!""",,
,"BUT the nurse said,—""I will set a mouse-trap!""",,
,"SO that is the story of the two Bad Mice,—but they were not so very very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke.",,
,"He found a crooked sixpence under the hearthrug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane.",,
,"AND very early every morning—before anybody is awake—Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!",,
