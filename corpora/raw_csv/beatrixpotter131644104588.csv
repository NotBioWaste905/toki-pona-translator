"Text start","The Tale of mrs. Tittlemouse",,"soweli Melili pi lili mute"
,"ONCE upon a time there was a wood-mouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse.",,"tenpo wan la soweli pi lili mute li lon, li lon ma pi kasi suli. kute sike tu li lon lawa ona. nimi ona li Melili."
,"She lived in a bank under a hedge.",,"tomo ona li lupa lon noka pi kasi kiwen anpa."
,"SUCH a funny house! There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to storerooms and nut-cellars and seed-cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge.",,"tomo li musi suwi a! ko ma la, lupa li tawa insa, li tawa, li tawa, li ken tawa tomo pi awen kili, li ken tawa tomo pi awen pan lon noka kasi kiwen."
,"THERE was a kitchen, a parlor, a pantry, and a larder.",,"tomo pi pali moku en tomo moku en tomo mute pi awen moku li lon kin."
,"Also, there was Mrs. Tittlemouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!",,"kin la, tomo lape pi soweli Melili lo lon. supa lape ona li poki lili a!"
,"MRS. TITTLEMOUSE was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.",,"soweli Melili li soweli pona nasin a, li wile weka e jakin tan tomo lon tenpo ale, li weka e ko ma e ko jaki lon ma supa lon tenpo ale."
,"Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.",,"tenpo la, pipi li ken kama lon nasin pi tomo ona."
,"Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet! said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dustpan.",,"ona li kalama kepeken ilo pi weka jaki, li toki wawa: ""o weka, o weka, noka jaki o!"""
,"AND one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.",,"tenpo suno wan la, pipi pi mute tenpo li kama, li jo e selo loje e sike pimeja lon loje."
,"Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your children!",,"""pipi mama Seloje o, ken la tomo sina li kama pakala a! o tawa wawa, o awen e pipi lili sina!"""
,"ANOTHER day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.",,"tenpo suno wan ante la, pipi suli pi noka luka tu wan li kama, li wile ala e telo kama lon ona tan sewi."
,"Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?",,"""a, toki a, ni li tomo ala pi meli Epipiku anu seme?"""
,"Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!",,"""o weka, pipi suli ike o! sina pana e linja len ko lon tomo mi a!"""
,"SHE bundled the spider out at a window.",,"soweli li wawa e tawa weka pipi, li kama weka e ona tan lupa lon sinpin."
,"He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.",,"pipi li kepeken linja ona, li kama anpa weka lon linja."
,"MRS. TITTLEMOUSE went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherry-stones and thistle-down seed for dinner.",,"soweli Melili li tawa sin, li wile tawa tomo weka pi awen moku, li wile e kiwen kili e pan pi kasi len walo tawa moku."
,"All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.",,"ona li lon nasin la, nena ona li pilin e kon. ona li lukin e ma anpa."
,"I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet.",,"""mi ken pilin e suwi sama ko tan pipi jelo pimeja; ni li tan kasi suwi kule lon poka tomo anu seme? pilin la, mi ken kute e noka lili jaki kin."
,"SUDDENLY round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble—""Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!"" said the bumble bee.",,"ni a la ona li kama lukin e pipi jelo pimeja Monsike—lipu pipi waso li mu pipi e mu e mu e mu!"
,"Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely. She wished that she had a broom.",,"soweli Melili li lukin e ona lon wile ike. ilo pi jaki weka li pona tawa wile ona lon tenpo ni."
,"Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. But what are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, and say, Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz? Mrs. Tittlemouse began to get cross.",,"""toki, pipi Monsike o; sina wile esun e ko suwi la, ni li pona tawa mi. taso sina lon ni pi tomo mi tan seme? sina kama kepeken lupa lukin lon tenpo ale tan seme? sina mu e mu pipi sina tan seme a?"" soweli li kama pilin utala."
,"ZIZZ, Wizz, Wizzz! replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak. She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.",,"pipi Monsike li kama pilin pi wile weka li mu ike wawa tan ni: mu, mu mu! ona li weka tawa tomo wan pi awen moku. tomo ni li tawa kili kiwen."
,"Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.",,"soweli Melili li moku e kili ale tan tomo ni lon tenpo pini; ni la, ala o lon tomo ni."
,"But it was full of untidy dry moss.",,"taso ko kasi laso mute pi telo ala li lon, li jaki."
,"MRS. TITTLEMOUSE began to pull out the moss. Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.",,"soweli Melili li kama weka e ko kasi. pipi tu wan en pipi wan kin li kama len ala tan ni, li mu pipi lon wawa."
,"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion! said Mrs. Tittlemouse. ""I will have them turned out—"" ""Buzz! Buzz! Buzzz!""—""I wonder who would help me?"" ""Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!""",,"soweli Melili li toki: ""nasin mi la, mi pana ala e tomo tawa jan ante; sina kama tan wile mi ala a, li pakala e nasin pona! mi kama weka e sina ale a—"" ""mu! mu! mu!""—""a jan seme li ken pana e pali weka ni tawa mi?"" ""mu, mu, mu!"""
,"—""I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet.""",,"—""a, mi wile ala e akesi Wekala; ona li weka ala e jaki tan noka ona lon tenpo ale."""
,"MRS. TITTLEMOUSE decided to leave the bees till after dinner.",,"pini la, soweli Melili li wile e ken pi weka pipi lon pini pi tenpo moku."
,"When she got back to the parlor, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself!",,"ona li kama lon tomo moku la, ona li kute e kalama uta wawa; a, ni a li akesi Wekala a!"
,"He was sitting all over a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.",,"akesi li lape e monsi ona lon supa lili pi tawa monsi sinpin. ona li musi e luka ona. uta ona li pona sewi tan pilin pona. noka ona li lon sinpin pi poki seli."
,"He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.",,"tomo ona li lupa telo lon anpa pi kasi kiwen."
,"HOW do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!",,"""toki, akesi Wekala o. ike a, telo mute li lon sina!"""
,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I'll sit awhile and dry myself, said Mr. Jackson.",,"akesi Wekala li toki: ""a, soweli Melili o, sina pona, sina pona, sina pona! mi awen lon ni la telo li kama weka tan mi a."""
,"He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.",,"ona li awen, li sinpin e pilin pona. telo li kama anpa lili tan len ona. soweli Melili li kepeken len, li weka e telo."
,"HE sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?",,"ona li awen lon tenpo mute a la ni li wile e toki tan soweli: ""sina wile e moku anu seme?"""
,"First she offered him cherry-stones. ""Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!"" said Mr. Jackson.",,
,"He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.",,
,"THEN she offered him thistle-down seed—""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff!"" said Mr. Jackson. He blew the thistle-down all over the room.",,
,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what I really—really should like—would be a little dish of honey!",,
,"IAM afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson! said Mrs. Tittlemouse.",,
,"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse! said the smiling Mr. Jackson, ""I can smell it; that is why I came to call.""",,
,"Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards.",,
,"Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dish-cloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor.",,
,"WHEN he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.",,
,"Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!",,
,"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!",,
,"FIRST he squeezed into the pantry.",,
,"Tiddly, widdly, widdly? no honey? no honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?",,
,"There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate-rack. Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.",,
,"THEN he squeezed into the larder. Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.",,
,"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!",,
,"And without any invitation! said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.",,
,"THEY went along the sandy passage—""Tiddly, widdly—"" ""Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!""",,
,"He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.",,
,"I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles, said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat-sleeve.",,
,"Get out, you nasty old toad! shrieked Babbitty Bumble.",,
,"I shall go distracted! scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.",,
,"SHE shut herself up in the nut-cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest. He seemed to have no objection to stings.",,
,"When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out—everybody had gone away.",,
,"But the untidiness was something dreadful—""Never did I see such a mess—smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown—and marks of big and little dirty feet—all over my nice clean house!""",,
,"SHE gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax.",,
,"Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.",,
,"I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!",,
,"SHE fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom. But she was too tired to do any more. First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.",,
,"Will it ever be tidy again? said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse.",,
,"NEXT morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fortnight.",,
,"She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with beeswax, and polished her little tin spoons.",,
,"WHEN it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.",,
,"He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door.",,
,"SO they handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended.",,
,"He sat outside in the sun, and said—""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!""",,
