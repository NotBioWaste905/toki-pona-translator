,"IT is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is ""soporific.""",,"toki la, sina moku e lipu kasi mute la ni li kama e lape a."
,"I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit.",,"taso mi pilin lape tan ni lon tenpo ala; taso mi soweli ala pi kute suli."
,"They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!",,"suli la, lipu kasi li lape a e kulupu soweli Lawako!"
,"WHEN Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.",,"soweli lili Penjamin li kama soweli suli a Penjamin la, ona en soweli sama ona Lawako pi kulupu ante li kama kulupu olin. ona li kama mama e soweli lili mute, li pilin pona musi, li pilin pona tawa tenpo kama ale."
,"I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the ""Flopsy Bunnies.""",,"soweli lili ale la mi ken ala awen e nimi ale lon sona mi; kulupu ni la, nimi pi soweli lili li ""kulupu soweli Lawako""."
,"AS there was not always quite enough to eat,—Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.",,"moku li mute pona lon tenpo ale ala la, soweli Penjamin li kama jo e kili lipu tan soweli sama Pita pi soweli Lawako. soweli Pita li lawa e ma kili."
,"SOMETIMES Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.",,"tenpo ken la, soweli Pita li ken ala pana e lipu tawa soweli Penjamin."
,"WHEN this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.",,"ni li kama la, kulupu Lawako li tawa lon ma, li tawa nena pi ijo jaki. nena ni li lon lupa lili, li lon poka pi ma kili lon tomo pi jan Mekeke."
,"MR. McGREGOR'S rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boat or two. One day—oh joy!—there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had ""shot"" into flower.",,"nena jaki pi jan Mekeke li jo e ijo ante mute. poki pi moku ko en poki kiwen en poki lipu li lon. ilo li weka e kasi anpa tan ma la kasi li lon nena ni (li nasa tawa pilin uta sama ilo). kili li kama jaki la ona li lon nena ni. poki tawa li lon kin. tenpo suno wan la pona li lon a—kili lipu mute a li lon, li kama suli, li kama kasi, li kama e kule suwi."
,"THE Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.",,"kulupo Lawako li moku mute a e kili lipu. tenpo li tawa la, soweli wan en soweli wan en soweli wan en soweli ante li kama lape, li lape lon ma supa."
,"Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.",,"soweli Penjamin la wawa lape li sama ala soweli lili ona. ona li kama lape la ona li len e lawa ona kepeken poki lipu tan pipi."
,"THE little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The blue-bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.",,"kulupu Lawako pi soweli lili li lape suwi lon suno seli. ma lon weka pi ma kili la, ilo pi weka kasi li kalama. pipi lili waso li tawa lon sinpin. soweli pi lili mute li mute tenpo, li luka e ijo lon nena jaki."
,"(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)",,"(mi ken pana e nimi ona. ni li soweli Melili, li soweli lon ma pi kasi suli, li jo e palisa suli lon monsi.)"
,"SHE rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.",,"ona li tawa lon poki lipu. ni li poki lipu po soweli Penjamin la, lape li kama pini."
,"The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.",,"soweli pi lili mute li wile ala ike e lape la, ona li toki e ni. toki ona kin la, soweli Melili li sona e soweli Pita pi kute suli."
,"WHILE she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot.",,"soweli Melili en soweli Penjamin li awen toki la, kalama noka wawa li kama tan sinpin poka, li lon sewi pi ona tu. kama wawa la, jan Mekeke li weka e jo tan poki. kasi weka mute li kama lon sewi pi kulupu Lawako a! soweli Penjamin li kama lili lon poki len ona. soweli Melili li len kepeken poki moku kiwen."
,"THE little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.",,"soweli pi kulupu Lawako li pilin suwi, li awen lape suwi lon kama ni; moku ona pi lape wawa la, ona li pini ala e lape lon kama kasi."
,"They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.",,"lon lape ona la, soweli mama ona Lawako li suwi awen mama e ona lon supa lape pona."
,"Mr. McGrcgor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them for some time.",,"jan Mekeke li pini e weka jo la, ona li lukin lon anpa. ona li kama lukin e pini pi kute suli suwi lon anpa pi kasi pana. ona li awen lukin."
,"PRESENTLY a fly settled on one of them and it moved.",,"tenpo ni la, pipi waso li kama lon kute wan. kute li tawa."
,"Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap—",,"jan Mekeke li tawa anpa, li tawa nena jaki—"
,"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits! said he as he dropped them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.",,"ona li kama jo e soweli. ""wan. tu. tu wan. tu tu! luka! soweli luka wan a!"" lon lape soweli la, mama suwi ona li luka e ona. soweli li tawa lili lon awen lape, taso lape li pini ala."
,"MR. McGREGOR tied up the sack and left it on the wall.",,"jan Mekeke li selo e poki, li kama e ona lon sinpin."
,"He went to put away the mowing machine.",,"ona li wile weka pona e ilo ona, li tawa ilo."
,"WHILE he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field.",,"ona li weka la, soweli Lawako li tawa (li awen lon tomo lon tenpo pini), li kama lon poka."
,"She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?",,"ona li lukin e poki kasi la poki li nasa tawa ona. soweli ante li lon seme?"
,"THEN the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.",,"ni la, soweli Melili li kama tan poki kiwen ona. soweli Penjamin li weka e poki lipu tan lawa ona. ona tu li toki e kama tawa soweli Lawako."
,"Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.",,"soweli Penjamin en soweli Lawako li pilin ike wawa, taso ona li ken ala open e poki soweli."
,"But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.",,"taso soweli Melili li sona pona. ona li pakala e anpa poki kepeken uta, li lon e lupa lon poki."
,"THE little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.",,"mama tu ona li kama weka e soweli lili ale tan poki, li luka e ona, li pini e lape ona."
,"Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.",,"poki la, soweli mama tu li insa e kili jaki mute, e ilo pi linja mute pimeja."
,"THEN they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.",,"ni la, ona li len tan jan Mekeke lon monsi kasi."
,"MR. McGREGOR came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.",,"jan Mekeke li kama sin, li jo e poki, li tawa."
,"He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.",,"poki li anpa mute lon luka ona tan wawa anpa poki."
,"The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.",,"kulupu Lawako li tawa lon monsi jan, li awen weka tan jan, li wile ala e lukin jan."
,"THEY watched him go into his house.",,"soweli li lukin la, jan li tawa insa tomo."
,"And then they crept up to the window to listen.",,"ona li tawa lupa lukin, li wile kute."
,"MR. McGREGOR threw down the sack on the stone ﬂoor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.",,
,"They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle—",,
,"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits! said Mr. McGregor.",,
,"EH? What's that? What have they been spoiling now? enquired Mrs. McGregor.",,
,"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits! repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers—""one, two, three—""",,
,"Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?",,
,"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six! replied Mr. McGregor.",,
,"(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)",,
,"MRS. McGREGOR took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel six, but they must be old rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.",,
,"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.",,
,"Line your old cloak? shouted Mr. McGregor—""I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!""",,
,"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.",,
,"MRS. McGREGOR untied the sack and put her hand inside.",,
,"When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that Mr. McGregor had ""done it a purpose.""",,
,"AND Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.",,
,"It was rather hurt.",,
,"THEN Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.",,
,"SO Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.",,
,"But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens. ",,
