,"IN the time of swords and periwigs and full-skirted coats with flowered lappets—when gentlemen wore ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of paduasoy and taffeta—there lived a tailor in Gloucester.",,"tenpo pi toki ni la, jan li jo e palisa utala kiwen, li len e lawa kepeken linja len suli, li len kepeken len suli pi namako pona mute, li len kepeken len pi linja sike mute, li len kepeken len pi sijelo sewi taso, li len kepeken len suno. tenpo pi toki ni la, jan pi pali len li lon ma tomo Kota."
,"He sat in the window of a little shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged on a table from morning till dark.",,"ona li lape e monsi ona lon poka pi lupa lukin, lon tomo pi pali len, lon nasin Lupawese. ona li nasin e noka ona kepeken nasin ante, li awen lon supa pali lon ale pi tenpo suno."
,"All day long while the light lasted he sewed and snippetted, piecing out his satin, and pompadour, and lutestring; stuffs had strange names, and were very expensive in the days of the Tailor of Gloucester.",,"suno li lon la, ona li pali len, li tu e len, li wan e len. ona li pali e len suno, e  len pi namako mute mute. len ale ni li nasa, taso ona li suli tawa jan pi tenpo ni, li mani mute."
,"But although he sewed fine silk for his neighbours, he himself was very, very poor—a little old man in spectacles, with a pinched face, old crooked fingers, and a suit of threadbare clothes.",,"taso jan pali li pali mute e len ni tawa jan ante la, ona li jo e mani pi lili mute. ona li lon tenpo mute, li wile kepeken ilo lukin. sinpin ona li ante tan tenpo. palisa luka ona li ante tan pali mute. len ona li kama wawa ala."
,"He cut his coats without waste; according to his embroidered cloth, they were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the table—""Too narrow breadths for nought—except waistcoats for mice,"" said the tailor.",,"jan pali li tu e len tawa ona taso la, ona li wile weka ala e len, li weka e len lili taso. len lili ni li lon supa pali la, ona li toki e ni: ""len ni li lili taso. mi ken ala kepeken ona. ni li pona tawa soweli pi lili mute taso."""
,"One bitter cold day near Christmas-time the tailor began to make a coat (a coat of cherry-coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses) and a cream-coloured satin waistcoat (trimmed with gauze and green worsted chenille) for the Mayor of Gloucester.",,"tenpo lete suli la, tenpo sewi li lon tenpo kama. jan pali li pali e len pi awen seli. (len ni li loje kili. linja ona li suno lili. kasi pi lipu kule li sitelen lon ona.) jan li pali e len pi sijelo sewi tan len pi walo jelo. (ko len walo en len ko pi laso kasi li lon pini pi lupa ona.) jan pali li pali e ni tawa jan lawa pi ma tomo Kota."
,"The tailor worked and worked, and he talked to himself. He measured the silk, and turned it round and round, and trimmed it into shape with his shears; the table was all littered with cherry-coloured snippets.",,"jan pali li pali, li pali la, ona li toki, taso toki ni li tawa ona taso. ona li lukin e suli len, li tawa e len lon nasin sike, lon nasin sike, li tu e len kepeken ilo. supa pali ona la, lili len loje mute li lon."
,"No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets for mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice! said the Tailor of Gloucester.",,"jan pali len pi ma Kota li toki e ni: ""suli len li lili a; mi tu e linja; suli len li lili taso; li pona tawa soweli pi lili mute taso"""
,"When the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window-panes and shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and satin lay cut out upon the table.",,"ko lete walo li kama tan sewi, li len e lupa lukin, li len e suno tan lupa la, jan pali li pini e pali. len pi pali pini li lon supa pali."
,"There were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat; and there were pocket-flaps and cuffs and buttons, all in order. For the lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta, and for the buttonholes of the waistcoat there was cherry-coloured twist. And everything was ready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient—except that there was wanting just one single skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk.",,"len lili luka luka tu li tawa len pi awen seli. len lili tu tu li tawa len pi sijelo sewi. len lipu pi poki pini en len namako pi luka pini en kiwen pi len awen li lon, li pona. len awen la, poka insa li jelo pona suno. len sijelo la, linja selo pi loje kili li lon lupa pi awen pini. ale li pona tawa pali pi tenpo suno kama la jan pali li ken wan e len — taso ijo wan li lon ala: linja loje li lili taso."
,"The tailor came out of his shop at dark, for he did not sleep there at nights; he fastened the window and locked the door, and took away the key. No one lived there at nights but little brown mice, and they ran in and out without any keys!",,"jan pi pali len li kama weka tan esun ona lon tenpo pimeja. ona li lape ala lon esun. ona li pini e lupa ale, li awen e ilo open. jan ala li lon tomo lon tenpo pimeja. soweli pi lili mute li lon, taso ona li kepeken ala ilo open."
,"For behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in Gloucester, there are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from house to house through those long, narrow passages; they can run all over the town without going into the streets.",,"tomo ale pi ma Kota la, ijo li lon insa sinpin. sona ala la, nasin lili pi tawa sewi en lupa lili li lon. soweli pi lili mute li kepeken ona, li ken tawa ale pi ma tomo, li ken awen lon insa kepeken nasin ala pi insa ala."
,"But the tailor came out of his shop and shuffled home through the snow; he lived quite near by in College Court, next the doorway to College Green. And although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only rented the kitchen.",,"a. jan pi pali len li kama weka tan esun ona, li tawa lon lete ko walo, li tawa tomo ona. tomo lape ona li lon nasin Masona, li lon poka pi ma kasi Petasona. tomo li tomo suli ala. taso jan pali li jo e mani lili taso la, ona li ken pana e mani tawa tomo moku taso, li awen lon ni taso."
,"He lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin.",,"ona li lon tomo la, soweli ona pi noka pi kalama ala li lon. nimi soweli li Sinkin."
,"Now all day long while the tailor was out at work, Simpkin kept house by himself; and he also was fond of the mice, though he gave them no satin for coats!",,"jan pali li weka, li pali lon ale pi tenpo suno la, soweli Sinkin li wan taso lon tomo. soweli pi lili mute li pona tawa ona. taso ona li pana ala e len pona tawa soweli lili."
,"Miaw? said the cat when the tailor opened the door, ""miaw?""",,"jan pali li open e lupa, li kama insa la, soweli li wile sona e ni: mu?"
,"The tailor replied: ""Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling. Take this groat (which is our last fourpence), and, Simpkin, take a china pipkin, buy a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk, and a penn'orth of sausages. And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our fourpence buy me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk. But do not lose the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a thread-paper, for I have no more twist.""",,"jan pali li toki e ni: ""soweli Sinkin o, mi kama jo e mani mute lon tenpo, taso wawa mi li lili sama linja lili. mi pana e mani lili ni. ona li mani mi nanpa pini. soweli Sinkin o, kepeken ona. o kepeken poki kiwen. mani ni la, o esun e pan wan, e telo walo wan tan soweli mani, e moku palisa ko soweli. mani li kama ala pini tan ni la, o esun linja loje tawa pali len mi kepeken mani pini. o weka ala e mani pini ni a, soweli Sinkin o. mani li kama weka la, mi kama weka kin, mi kama anpa tan weka pi linja loje."
,"Then Simpkin again said ""Miaw!"" and took the groat and the pipkin, and went out into the dark.",,"soweli Sinkin li mu sin, li jo e mani e poki, li tawa ma lon pimeja."
,"The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill. He sat down by the hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.",,"jan pali li pilin lape mute. sijelo ona li kama nasa; ona li pilin nasa. ona li tawa poka pi poki seli, li toki e len pi pali ona tawa ona taso."
,"I shall make my fortune—to be cut bias—the Mayor of Gloucester is to be married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoat—to be lined with yellow taffeta—and the taffeta sufficeth; there is no more left over in snippets than will serve to make tippets for mice——",,"mani mute o kama tawa mi. len o selo lon sijelo sama selo sijelo. jan lawa pi ma tomo Kota en olin ona li kama wan lon tenpo suno sewi. ona li toki e wile ona la ona li wile e len pi awen seli, e len pi sijelo sewi kepeken linja namako — kepeken len suno jelo kin. mute pi len suno ni li pona; mi ken ala kepeken len suno lili, mi ken kepeken ona tawa soweli pi lili mute a taso——"
,"Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises—",,"lon tenpo ni a la ona li tawa sewi kepeken wawa tan ni: kalama lili li kama tan supa poki lon poka ante tomo—"
,"Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!",,"noka-noka-noka-noka lili a!"
,"Now what can that be? said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his chair. The dresser was covered with crockery and pipkins, willow pattern plates, and tea-cups and mugs.",,"jan pi pali len li toki e ni: aa, ni li seme? ona li tawa sewi tan supa ona. ilo moku en poki moku en pki telo en kiwen supa moku li lon supa poki."
,"The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser, listening, and peering through his spectacles. Again from under a teacup came those funny little noises—",,"jan pali li tawa supa poki, li awen lon poka ona, li kute, li lukin kepeken ilo oko ona. sin la, kalama musi ni li tan poki telo wan—"
,"Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!",,"noka-noka-noka-noka lili a!"
,"This is very peculiar, said the Tailor of Gloucester, and he lifted up the tea-cup which was upside down.",,"jan pali li toki e ni: ni li nasa a. ona li sewi e poki telo."
,"Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a courtesy to the tailor! Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.",,"soweli pi lili mute li kama tan anpa poki. ona li anpa lili sama pona toki tawa jan pali. ona li tawa weka tan supa poki, li tawa anpa sinpin."
,"The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands, and mumbling to himself:—",,"jan li tawa sin lon poka seli, li seli e luka ona, li toki tawa ona taso:—"
,"The waistcoat is cut out from peach-coloured satin—tambour stitch and rose-buds in beautiful floss silk! Was I wise to entrust my last fourpence to Simpkin? One-and-twenty buttonholes of cherry-coloured twist!",,"a, len pali li tan len suno loje, kepeken linja sitelen sama kasi kule, kepeken linja ko! a, mi pana e mani pini mi tawa soweli Sinkin la, ni li pona ala pona? a, kiwen len li kepeken linja loje!"
,"But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises—",,"taso tenpo ni la, kalama lili ante li kama tan supa poki"
,"Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!",,"noka-noka-noka-noka lili a!"
,"This is passing extraordinary! aid the Tailor of Gloucester, and turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.",,"ja pali li pilin e ni: ni li kama nasa a! ona li sewi e poki telo ante."
,"Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!",,"soweli mije pi lili mute li kama tan anpa poki, li anpa lili sama pona toki tawa jan pali!"
,"And then from all over the dresser came a chorus of little tappings, all sounding together, and answering one another, like watch-beetles in an old worm-eaten window-shutter—",,"ni la, kalama mute pi noka mute pi li kama, li kama tan ale pi supa poki, li kama kalama kulupu, li kalama sama toki kulupu, li kalama mute."
,"Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!",,"noka-noka-noka-noka lili a!"
,"And out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other and more little mice, who hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot.",,"tan anpa pi poki lili la, tan poki telo la, tan poki moku la, tan poku supa la, soweli mute pi lili mute li kama, li tawa weka, li tawa anpa sinpin."
,"The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting: ""One-and-twenty buttonholes of cherry-coloured silk! To be finished by noon of Saturday: and this is Tuesday evening. Was it right to let loose those mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin? Alack, I am undone, for I have no more twist!""",,"jan pali li kama anpa lon poka seli, li toki e pilin ike ona: ""kiwen len mute wan o lon, o kepeken linja loje a! ona o kama pini lon pini pi tenpo suno nanpa luka wan. a, tenpo ni li pini pi tenpo suno nanpa tu. mi ken e weka pi soweli lili ni la, ni li nasin ala nasin? pilin la, soweli Sinkin li lawa e ona. ike a, mi kama anpa, mi kama pini, tan ni: linja len loje li lon ala a."""
,"The little mice came out again and listened to the tailor; they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat. They whispered to one another about the taffeta lining and about little mouse tippets.",,"soweli pi lili mute li kama sin, li kute e toki pi jan pali. ona li lukin e pona pi pali jan, e pona len. ona li toki kulupu, li toki e len suno jelo pona, e linja namako, e len lili tawa pona pi soweli lili."
,"And then suddenly they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another as they ran from house to house; and not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin came back with the pipkin of milk!",,"wawa la, ona li tawa weka kepeken wawa, li tawa anpa sinpin, li lon nasin pi insa sinpin. ona li mu lili, li wile tawa kulupu, li kama weka tan tomo. soweli Sinkin li jo e moku, li kama sin lon tomo jan la, soweli lili ala a li awen lon tomo."
,"Simpkin opened the door and bounced in, with an angry ""G-r-r-miaw!"" like a cat that is vexed; for he hated the snow, and there was snow in his ears, and snow in his collar at the back of his neck. He put down the loaf and the sausages upon the dresser, and sniffed.",,"soweli Sinkin li open e luka, li tawa insa, li mu e mu pi pilin ike. ona li pilin ike tan lete. ko walo lete li lon, li lon kute ona, li lon sewi ona, li lon insa pi len nimi ona. ona li pana e moku tawa supa, li pilin e kon kepeken nena."
,"Simpkin, said the tailor, ""where is my twist?""",,"jan pali li toki tawa ona: ""soweli Sinkin o, linja loje mi li lon seme?"""
,"But Simpkin set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups. He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!",,"taso soweli Sinkin li pana e poki kiwen lon supa, li lukin e poki telo taso lon supa, li pilin e ken nasa. ona li wile moku e soweli pona pi lili mute!"
,"Simpkin, said the tailor, ""where is my twist?""",,"jan pali li toki tawa ona: ""soweli Sinkin o, linja mi li lon seme?"""
,"But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: ""Where is my Mouse?""",,"taso soweli Sinkin li len e ijo jan lon poki lon tenpo pini, li mu ike tawa jan pali. ona li ken ala toki, taso ona li ken la, ona li wile toki e ni: ""soweli lili mi li lon seme?"""
,"Alack, I am undone! said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.",,"jan pali li kalama e ni: ""a! mi kama anpa, mi kama weka, mi kama pakala!"" pilin ike ona la, ona li tawa supa lape ona."
,"All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen, peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!",,"tenpo pimeja ni la, soweli Sinkin li alasa, li alasa lon ale pi tomo moku, li lukin lon insa supa, li lukin lon insa sinpin, li lukin lon insa poki lon linja loje pi jan pali, li wile e soweli lili. taso ona li ken ala lukin e soweli lili."
,"And whenever the tailor muttered and talked in his sleep, Simpkin said: ""Miaw-ger-r-w-s-s-ch!"" and made strange, horrid noises, as cats do at night.",,"jan pali li lape. ona li kalama lon lape la, soweli Sinkin li mu tawa ona, li kalama nasa, li kalama jaki. ni li nasin soweli lon tenpo pimeja."
,"For the poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled: ""No more twist! no more twist!""",,"sijelo pi jan pali li kama ike, li kama seli. lape la, ona li tawa mute lon supa lape. ona li toki lape: ""a, linja li lon ala! a, linja li lon ala!"""
,"All that day he was ill, and the next day, and the next; and what should become of the cherry-coloured coat? In the tailor's shop in Westgate Street the embroidered silk and satin lay cut out upon the table—one-and-twenty buttonholes—and who should come to sew them, when the window was barred, and the door was fast locked?",,
,"But that does not hinder the little brown mice; they run in and out without any keys through all the old houses in Gloucester!",,
,"Out-of-doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their geese and turkeys, and to bake their Christmas pies; but there would be no Christmas dinner for Simpkin and the poor old tailor of Gloucester.",,
,"The tailor lay ill for three days and nights; and then it was Christmas Eve, and very late at night. The moon climbed up over the roofs and chimneys, and looked down over the gateway into College Court. There were no lights in the windows, nor any sound in the houses; all the city of Gloucester was fast asleep under the snow.",,
,"And still Simpkin wanted his mice, and mewed as he stood beside the four-post bed.",,
,"But it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk in the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).",,
,"When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer—like an echo of the chimes—and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow.",,
,"From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes—all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells.",,
,"First and loudest the cocks cried out: ""Dame, get up, and bake your pies!""",,
,"Oh, dilly, dilly, dilly! sighed Simpkin.",,
,"And now in a garret there were lights and sounds of dancing, and cats came from over the way.",,
,"Hey, diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle! All the cats in Gloucester—except me, said Simpkin,",,
,"Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jackdaws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; the air was quite full of little twittering tunes.",,
,"But it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin.",,
,"Particularly he was vexed with some little shrill voices from behind a wooden lattice. I think that they were bats, because they always have very small voices—especially in a black frost, when they talk in their sleep, like the Tailor of Gloucester.",,
,"They said something mysterious that sounded like—",,
,"Buzz, quoth the blue fly; hum, quoth the bee; Buzz and hum they cry, and so do we!",,"pipi waso lili laso li mu; pipi waso pimeja jelo li mu. mu li kalama tan ona tu. ni la, mi kalama sama ni tu."
,"and Simpkin went away shaking his ears as if he had a bee in his bonnet.",,
,"From the tailor's shop in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles. There was a snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily:",,
,"⁠ ""Four-and-twenty tailors Went to catch a snail, The best man amongst them Durst not touch her tail; She put out her horns Like a little kyloe cow. Run, tailors, run! or she'll have you all e'en now!""⁠ Then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again:",,
,"Sieve my lady's oatmeal, Grind my lady's flour, Put it in a chestnut, Let it stand an hour——",,
,"Mew! Mew! interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door. But the key was under the tailor's pillow; he could not get in.",,
,"The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune—",,
,"Three little mice sat down to spin, Pussy passed by and she peeped in. What are you at, my fine little men? Making coats for gentlemen. Shall I come in and cut off your threads? Oh, no, Miss Pussy, you'd bite off our heads!",,
,"Mew! Mew! cried Simpkin.",,"soweli Sinkin li kalama: mu! mu!"
,"Hey diddle dinketty! answered the little mice—",,
,"Hey diddle dinketty, poppetty pet! The merchants of London they wear scarlet; Silk in the collar, and gold in the hem, So merrily march the merchantmen!",,
,"They clicked their thimbles to mark the time, but none of the songs pleased Simpkin; he sniffed and mewed at the door of the shop.",,
,"And then I bought A pipkin and a popkin, A slipkin and a slopkin, All for one farthing——and upon the kitchen dresser! added the rude little mice.",,
,"Mew! scratch! scratch! scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout at once in little twittering voices: ""No more twist! No more twist!"" And they barred up the window-shutters and shut out Simpkin.",,
,"But still through the nicks in the shutters he could hear the click of thimbles, and little mouse voices singing:",,
,"No more twist! No more twist!",,
,"Simpkin came away from the shop and went home considering in his mind. He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.",,
,"Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the tea-pot; and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice!",,
,"When the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw, upon the patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and beside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!",,
,"Alack, I am worn to a ravelling, said the tailor of Gloucester, ""but I have my twist!""",,
,"The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.",,
,"The starlings whistled on the chimney stacks, and the throstles and robins sang—but they sang their own little noises, not the words they had sung in the night.",,
,"Alack, said the tailor, ""I have my twist; but no more strength—nor time—than will serve to make me one single buttonhole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning! The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon —and where is his cherry-coloured coat?""",,
,"He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something.",,
,"But there was no one there! Not even one little brown mouse!",,
,"The boards were swept and clean; the little ends of thread and the little silk snippets were all tidied away, and gone from off the floor.",,
,"But upon the table—oh joy! the tailor gave a shout—there, where he had left plain cuttings of silk there lay the most beautifullest coat and embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester!",,
,"There were roses and pansies upon the facings of the coat; and the waistcoat was worked with poppies and corn-flowers.",,
,"Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured buttonhole, and where that buttonhole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words—in little teeny weeny writing—",,
,"NO MORE TWIST.",,
,"And from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite stout, and he grew quite rich.",,
,"He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.",,
,"Never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets! But his buttonholes were the greatest triumph of it all.",,
,"The stitches of those buttonholes were so neat—so neat—I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble.",,
,"The stitches of those buttonholes were so small—so small—they looked as if they had been made by little mice!",,
