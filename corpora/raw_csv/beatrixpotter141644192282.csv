,"ONCE upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes. He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.",,"tenpo wan la, soweli lili pi kasi suli li lon. ona li sike pona, li pilin pona lon nasin ona, li pimeja walo sama kiwen. ona li soweli Nokama. tomo ona li supa lon sewi pi kasi suli. sewi tomo la, lipu kasi li selo supa. soweli olin ona li soweli Pono."
,"TIMMY TIPTOES sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled—""Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring."" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch—""The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter."" ""Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring-time,"" replied prudent Timothy.",,"soweli Nokama li lon kasi, li pilin pona lon tawa kon la, ona li tawa wawa e palisa linja lon monsi ona, li musi lili tan pilin pona ona—""olin Pono pona o, kili li pona lon tenpo ni; mi o pali e awen kili pi tenpo lete."" tenpo pi toki ni la, soweli Pono li pana e ko kasi awen tawa selo tomo sewi—""tomo li pona mute a la, mi ken lape lon ale pi tenpo lete suli."" soweli Nokama li toki e wile awen: ""ni la, sijelo mi li kama lili sama ala sike tan weka moku lon tenpo pi lape pini. moku li lon tenpo pi seli kama la, ike pi weka moku li lon ala."""
,"WHEN Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already.",,"soweli Nokama en soweli Pono li tawa ma pi mute kasi la, soweli ante kin pi kasi suli li lon."
,"Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves.",,"soweli Nokama li kama jo ala e len ona, li pana e len lon palisa lili kasi; ona tu li tawa lon poka ala pi soweli ante."
,"EVERY day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.",,"tenpo ale la, ona li tawa sin lon tenpo mute, li kama jo e kili kiwen mute, li poki e kili, li awen e ona lon lupa anpa kasi lon poka pi kasi tomo ona."
,"WHEN these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled down—down—down inside.",,"lupa anpa ale li ken ala jo e ijo ante la, ona li pana e kili tawa lupa kasi sewi. lupa ni li tomo tawa waso pi nena wawa; kili li tawa anpa—li tawa anpa—li tawa anpa lon insa."
,"How shall you ever get them out again? It is like a money-box! said Goody.",,"soweli Pono li toki: ""kili li ken kama weka tan ni kepeken nasin seme? ni li sama poki awen a!"""
,"I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love, said Timmy Tiptoes, peeping into the hole.",,"soweli Nokama li lukin e lupa, li toki: ""a, olin mi o, tenpo pi seli kama li kama la, sijelo mi li kama lili."""
,"THEY did collect quantities—because they did not lose them! Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place.",,"ona li kama jo e mute kili a tan ni—kili li kama ala weka tan ona! soweli pi kasi suli li anpa e kili lon anpa ma la, kili li kama weka tan ona tan ni: soweli li awen ala sona e ma kili."
,"The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began to dig, and he could not remember. And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other squirrels began to dig,—the whole wood was in commotion!",,"soweli wan li weka mute e sona ni. ona li soweli Selinja. ona li open e pali, li lupa e ma, taso ona li sona ala e ma pona. ni la ona li lupa sin e ma, li kama jo e kili pi soweli ante. ni li kama e utala. soweli ante li open e pali lupa lon ma la—utala li lon ale pi ma kasi."
,"UNFORTUNATELY, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.",,"ike la, tenpo ni la, kulupu pi waso lili li kama tan kon, li tawa kasi. ona li wile moku e pipi. waso pi ante mute li lon, li mu e kalama pi ante mute."
,"The first one sang—""Who's bin digging-up my nuts? Who's-been-digging-up my nuts?""",,"waso wan li mu—""mu, jan seme li jo e kili mi, mu? mu, jan seme li jo e kili mi, mu?"""
,"And another sang—""Little bita bread and-no-cheese! Little bit-a-bread an'-no-cheese!""",,"waso ante li mu—""mu, pan lili taso en ko moku ala, mu! mu, pan lili taso en ko moku ala, mu!"""
,"THE squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang—""Who's-bin digging-up my nuts? Who's been digging-up my-nuts?""",,"soweli mute li kama tawa waso, li kute e ona. waso nanpa wan li tawa kasi kiwen anpa. soweli Nokama en soweli Pono li lon kasi ni, li selo e poki ona. waso li mu—""mu, jan seme li jo e kili mi, mu? mu, jan seme li jo e kili mi, mu?"""
,"Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer. It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all.",,"soweli Nokama li awen pali, li toki ala tawa waso. kin la, waso lili ni li wile ala e toki tan soweli. ona li toki ala, li mu taso tan nasin mu waso. mu ona li pana ala e toki e sona."
,"BUT when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!",,"taso soweli ante li kute e mu ni, ona li tawa soweli Nokama kepeken wawa utala, li utala e ona, li nasa e poki ona. utala ike ni la, waso lili pi pona taso li tawa weka lon pilin ike!"
,"Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting—""Who's-been digging-up my-nuts?""",,"soweli Nokama li anpa, li tawa lon anpa ma, li tawa lon anpa ma. ona li tawa monsi, li tawa weka, li tawa tomo ona. kulupu soweli li lon monsi ona, li kalama—""jan seme li jo e kili mi?"""
,"THEY caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs. ""We will leave him here till he confesses,"" said Silvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole—",,"kulupu soweli li kama tawa soweli Nokama, li kama jo e ona. kulupu li tawa e soweli, li kama e soweli lon sewi kasi. tenpo pini la, soweli Nokasi li pana e kili tawa lupa lon sewi pi kasi ni. kulupu li wile insa e soweli Nokasi lon lupa, taso lupa li lili la, ona li ken ala insa tan suli soweli. kulupu li kepeken wawa, li tawa wawa e soweli, li ike e soweli. pona la, soweli Nokama li kama ala pakala tan ni. soweli Selinja li toki: ""mi awen e ona lon insa tawa tenpo ni: ona li toki e pali ike ona."" soweli Selinja li kalama tawa insa kasi—"
,"Who's-been-digging-up my-nuts?",,"""jan seme li jo e kili mi?"""
,"TIMMY TIPTOES made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself. He lay quite stunned and still.",,
,"GOODY TIPTOES picked up the nut bags and went home. She made a cup of tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.",,
,"Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. Next morning she ventured back to the nut-bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels drove her away.",,
,"She wandered all over the wood, calling—",,
,"Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tiptoes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?",,
,"IN the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to be under ground. Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him. There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?",,
,"It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its night-cap; and the house was full of provisions.",,
,"THE Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree—""Besides, I found a few buried!"" It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities—""But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself? My wife will be anxious!"" ""Just another nut—or two nuts; let me crack them for you,"" said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!",,
,"NOW Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any more nuts into the wood-pecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.",,
,"IT is getting perfectly full-up down-stairs; the sitting-room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?",,
,"I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not not know that anybody lived here, said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; ""but where is Chippy Hackee? My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too."" ""I know where Chippy is; a little bird told me,"" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.",,
,"SHE led the way to the wood-pecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.",,
,"Down below there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together—",,
,"My little old man and I fell out, How shall we bring this matter about? Bring it about as well as you can, And get you gone, you little old man!",,34
,"YOU could squeeze in, through that little round hole, said Goody Tiptoes. ""Yes, I could,"" said the Chipmunk, ""but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!""",,
,"Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang—",,
,"For the diddlum day Day diddle dum di! Day diddle diddle dum day!",,
,"THEN Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down—""Timmy Tiptoes! Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!"" And Timmy replied, ""Is that you, Goody Tiptoes? Why, certainly!""",,
,"He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he could not get out.",,
,"Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.",,
,"AND so it went on for a fortnight; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.",,
,"Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.",,
,"BUT Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable.",,
,"AT last a large bear came walking through the wood. Perhaps he also was looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.",,
,"CHIPPY HACKEE went home in a hurry!",,
,"AND when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head; and he was more uncomfortable still.",,
,"And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut-store fastened up with a little padlock.",,
,"AND whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings—""Who's-been-digging-up my-nuts? Who's been digging-up my-nuts?"" But nobody ever answers!",,
