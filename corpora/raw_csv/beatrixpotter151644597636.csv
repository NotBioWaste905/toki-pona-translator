,"IHAVE made many books about well-behaved people. Now, for a change, I am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.",,"a, jan pi nasin pona la, mi pali e lipu mute. taso tenpo ni la, mi toki e jan ike tu. ona li soweli Tokije, li soweli Lisa."
,"Nobody could call Mr. Tod ""nice."" The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off. He was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.",,"jan li toki e soweli Lisa la, ona li ""pona"" ala. soweli pi kute suli la, soweli Lisa li ike; soweli kute li ken pilin e kon ona lon weka. soweli Lisa li tawa ma mute; soweli ante li sona ala e kama ona e tenpo ona e ma pi kama ona."
,"One day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.",,"tenpo suno wan la, soweli Lisa li awen lon tomo pi palisa kasi mute. ma ni la, jan li awen weka e kiwen tan kasi, li lili e kasi lon tenpo, li ken e suli kasi lon tenpo. ma ni li poka lon tomo pi soweli Penjakin la, ni li kama e pilin ike tawa kulupu soweli ona pi kute suli. tenpo suno kama la, soweli Lisa li tawa ma ante lon poka telo. ni li ike e pilin pi waso telo, e pilin pi soweli lili telo."
,"In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.",,"tenpo lete en tenpo pi kama seli la, soweli Lisa li ken lon ma, lon poka kiwen, li lon sewi pi nena Jasimani, li lon anpa pi ma Panpa."
,"He had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.",,"ona li lawa e tomo mute, taso ona li jo ala e tomo sama lon tenpo ale, li lon ala tomo lon tenpo mute."
,"The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved out; because sometimes Tommy Brock moved in; (without asking leave).",,"soweli Lisa li weka la, jan li ken lon kin; tenpo la, soweli Tokije li kama lon insa tomo (li kama tan ala wile pi soweli Lisa)."
,"Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he grinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up.",,"soweli Tokije li suli mute lon sewi, li suli lon poka, li sewi e uta ona sama pilin pona. pali ona en nasin ona li pona ala. ona li moku e tomo pipi, e akesi, e pipi ko linja; ona li tawa lon insa pi tenpo pimeja, li alasa e ijo tan anpa ma."
,"His clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the day-time, he always went to bed in his boots. And the bed which he went to bed in was generally Mr. Tod's.",,"len ona li jaki mute; ona li lape lon tenpo suno la, ona li weka ala e poki len noka lon supa lape. ona li tawa supa lape la, supa lape ni li supa pi soweli Lisa."
,"Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer, they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.",,"a, soweli Tokije li kama moku e soweli lili pi kute suli lon tenpo; taso ni li lon tenpo pi weka moku taso. ona li pona tawa soweli Penjakin pi kute suli. ona tu li pilin sama tawa soweli telo wile ike, li pilin sama tawa soweli Lisa ike; tenpo mute la, ona tu li toki e ni."
,"Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years. He sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.",,"tenpo li mute lon soweli Penjakin. ona li awen lon suno lon tenpo suno pi kama seli, li lon poka pi lupa tomo ona. ona li jo e len pi awen seli lon anpa lawa, li moku e kon pimeja tan ilo seli namako ona."
,"He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who had a young family. Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.",,"soweli Penjakin li mama pi soweli Penjamin. soweli Penjamin en soweli Penjamin en soweli Lawako li lon tomo sama. soweli Lawako li olin pi soweli Penjamin, li mama e kulupu pi soweli lili. soweli Penjamin en soweli Lawako li tawa weka la, soweli Penjakin li lawa e kulupu pi soweli lili."
,"The little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole. To tell the truth—old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.",,"soweli lili li sin mute, taso ona li ken open e lukin laso ona, li ken utala kepeken noka ona. ona li lon supa lape lon ko suwi linja lon ko pona kasi, li lon tomo lili lon weka pi tomo lawa. lon la, soweli Penjakin li weka e soweli lili tan sona ona."
,"He sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging, and some mole traps. He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them. And the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter—""I have not had a good square meal for a fortnight, I am living on pig-nuts. I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!"" said Tommy Brock.",,"ona li awen lon suno seli, li toki pona tawa soweli Tokije. soweli Tokije li tawa lon ma kasi la, ona li kama tawa tomo pi soweli Penjakin kin. ona li jo e poki len, e ilo ma lili pi pali lupa, e ilo poki alasa tawa soweli pi anpa ma. ona li toki e pilin ike tan mute ala pi sike waso. toki ona la, soweli Lisa li alasa e sike ni pi pona moku. toki ona kin la, soweli telo li moku e akesi ale lon tenpo lete suli pi lape ona—ona li toki: ""mi kama ala moku pona lon tenpo suno mute a. mi moku e kili kiwen taso pi anpa ma. ken la mi kama ala moku e soweli. ken la mi moku e monsi mi a!"""
,"It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.",,"ni li toki musi ala, taso ni li musi lili tawa soweli Penjakin tan ni: soweli Tokije li suli lon poka, li sewi e uta kin sama pilin musi."
,"So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to taste a slice of seed-cake and ""a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip wine."" Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.",,"ni la, soweli Penjakin li mu e pilin pona; ona li wile e kama pi soweli Tokije lon insa tomo, li ken e moku pi pan suwi, e moku pi ""telo kasi suwi nasa tan soweli Lawako pi kulupu mi."" soweli Tokije li toki kepeken wawa, li tawa insa lupa, li kama selo e lupa, li kama lon insa."
,"Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow. Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.",,"ni la, soweli Penjakin li moku e kon tan ilo kon seli ante, li pana e palisa kasi namako pi kon seli tawa soweli Tokije. kon palisa li wawa mute la, ni li sewi mute a e uta pi soweli Tokije; kon li insa ale lon tomo. soweli Penjakin li pana weka wawa e kon jaki, li mu tan musi; soweli Tokije li pana weka lili e kon pimeja, li sewi e uta."
,"And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . When Flopsy and Benjamin came back old Mr. Bouncer woke up. Tommy Brock and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared!",,"soweli Penjakin li mu tan musi, li mu, li pana wawa e kon, li pini e lukin tan kon nasa pi palisa kasi. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . soweli Lawako en soweli Penjamin li kama sin la, soweli Penjakin li pini e lape. soweli Tokije en soweli lili ale pi kute suli li weka a!"
,"Mr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole. But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him.",,"soweli Penjakin li wile ala toki e kama pi jan ante lon tomo ni. taso pilin kon li pana e sona tan soweli pi linja walo pimeja. sona kin la, lupa noka li sike lon ko ma. soweli Penjakin li ike; soweli Lawako li poka e kute ona, li utala e soweli Penjakin."
,"Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.",,"soweli Penjamin li open e alasa tawa soweli Tokije kepeken wile utala."
,"There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his footmark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood. Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel. There he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap. A little stream crossed the way. Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.",,"alasa li wile ala e lukin mute. soweli Lisa li pana e lupa noka lon ma, li kama tawa nasin lon ma kasi. ma wan la, ona li kama weka e ko kasi, e kasi lili. ma ante la, ona li kama lupa e ma, li pana e ilo poki alasa lon anpa kasi lon lupa. telo linja lili li lon nasin, li tu e nasin. soweli Penjamin li tawa sewi telo, li noka ala e telo; soweli Tokije li noka wawa la, ni li pana e lupa wawa lon ko ma telo. "
,"The path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared; there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths—but the smell that made Benjamin stop was not the smell of flowers!",,"nasin li awen la, nasin li tawa mute kasi. jan li weka ala e kasi lon ma ni; kiwen kasi anpa li pana e lipu kasi; kasi suwi mute mute pi laso sewi li lon kin—taso soweli Penjamin li pini e tawa tan kon lon nena ona la, kon ni li kon tan ala kasi suwi!"
," Mr. Tod's stick-house was before him; and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home. There was not only a foxey flavour in proof of it—there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.",,"tomo palisa pi soweli Lisa li lon sinpin ona; tenpo pi soweli Penjamin kama la, soweli Lisa li lon tomo a. kon pi soweli Lisa li pana e sona ni—taso kon tomo kin li pana e sona: poki pakala li lon sewi tomo, li lupa kon la, kon pimeja li kama tan lupa."
,"Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring; his whiskers twitched. Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate, and said something. Benjamin stamped his foot, and bolted.",,"soweli Penjamin li sewi awen e sijelo ona. linja suli ona li tawa lon sinpin ona. lon insa tomo la, jan li kama anpa pakala e supa lili moku, li toki. noka pi soweli Penjamin li utala e ma. ona li tawa weka."
,"He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. Apparently Tommy Brock had turned the same way. Upon the top of the wall there were again the marks of badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar.",,"ona li pini ala e tawa, li tawa poka ante pi ma pi kasi suli. lukin la, soweli Tokije kin li tawa poka ma sama lon tenpo pini. sinpin kiwen la, pakala lili li tan noka soweli; kin la, linja len lili li lon kasi palisa tan poki len."
,"Benjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow. He found another mole trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock. It was getting late in the afternoon. Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air. One of them in a blue coat, by himself, was busily hunting for dandelions.—""Cousin Peter! Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!"" shouted Benjamin Bunny.",,"soweli Penjamin li tawa sinpin kiwen, li tawa sewi lon sinpin. ona li kama lukin e ilo alasa poki sin; ni la, ona li awen lon nasin alasa pi soweli Tokije. tan tenpo la, suno li kama anpa. soweli ante pi kute suli li kama tan tomo ona, li pilin e pona tan kon pi tenpo ni. soweli wan li jo e len laso. ona li alasa e kasi moku pona.—soweli Penjamin li kalama: ""soweli sama o! soweli Pita o! soweli sama Pita o!"""
,"The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears—",,"soweli ni pi len laso li sewi e sijelo ona, e kute suli ona—"
,"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?",,"""seme li lon, soweli sama Penjamin o? soweli alasa pi kalama ala anu soweli lili Kijemisantakalu anu seme?"""
,"No, no, no! He's bagged my family—Tommy Brock—in a sack—have you seen him?",,"""ala a, ala, ala! ona-a, soweli Tokije-li poki e kulupu mi—lon poki len—sina lukin ala lukin e ona?"""
,"Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?",,"""soweli Tokije anu seme? nanpa soweli li seme, soweli sama o?"""
,"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins! Did he come this way? Please tell me quick!",,"""luka wan, soweli sama o. ona ale li kama tan mama lon tenpo sama! soweli ike li kama ala kama lon nasin ni? o pana a e sona a!"""
,"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since . . . . he said they were caterpillars; I did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars.",,"""kama. kama a. ni li lon tenpo lili... toki ona la, pipi taso li lon poki len ona. pilin mi la, insa poki li tawa wawa sama ala pipi."""
,"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?",,"""tawa nasin seme? soweli Pita o, ona li tawa seme?"""
,"He had a sack with something 'live in it; I watched him set a mole trap. Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning. Benjamin did so.",,"""a, ona li jo e poki, li jo e ijo tawa lon poki; mi lukin la, ona li pana e ilo alasa poki tawa ma. mi wile kepeken pona tan lawa mi, soweli sama o; sina o toki e kama ale a."" soweli Penjamin li ni."
," ""My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years;"" said Peter reflectively, ""but there are two hopeful circumstances. Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had refreshments. He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast."" ""Which way?"" ""Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself. I know very well which way. Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to Mr. Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks. I partly know, because he offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail's; he said he would be passing."" (Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on the hill.)",,"soweli Pita li toki: ""tenpo pi soweli mama sina li mute, taso ona li awen ala lon nasin pona; taso ijo tu li ken pona e ike. nanpa wan la, kulupu sina li awen, li awen tawa; nanppa tu la, soweli Tokije li kama moku lon tenpo pini. ken suli la, ona li tawa lape, li wile moku e soweli sina lon open pi tenpo suno kama."" ""nasin seme a?"" ""soweli Penjamin, o awen pona. mi sona e nasin. soweli Lisa li lon tomo palisa ona la, soweli Tokije li tawa tomo ante pi soweli Lisa lon sewi pi nena Jasimani. mi ken kama sona tan ni: toki ona la, ona li tawa poka lon tomo pi soweli sama mi Monsiko, li ken pana e toki mi tawa ona."" (soweli Monsiko en soweli pimeja li kama kulupu olin. tomo ona li lon nena.) "
,"Peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was all of a twitter. They crossed several fields and began to climb the hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen. He seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.",,"soweli Pita li weka len e kasi pona ona, li tawa lon poka pi soweli pilin. pilin ni li wawa ike lon soweli Penjamin. ona li tawa lon ma mute pi kasi lili, li kama tawa sewi nena; lupa noka li wile ala e lukin mute. lukin la, soweli Tokije li anpa e poki lon ma lon tenpo mute tan lape."
,"He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent. What a nasty person! said Peter.",,"soweli Pita li toki: ""mi la, ona li wile pana e kon mute tan pali; mi pilin e kon ona la, mi lon monsi ona a. a, kon ona li jaki!"""
,"The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures. Half way up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half-grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.",,"suno li seli kin lon tenpo ni, li suno e poka nena. lon sewi nena pi suli ale ala la, soweli Monsiko li awen lon lupa pi tomo ona. soweli lili mute li musi lon poka ona. soweli wan li pimeja, soweli ante li jelo pimeja."
,"Cottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance. Asked whether her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice while she watched him.",,"tenpo pini la, soweli Monsiko li kama lukin e soweli Tokije lon weka lili. tenpo pi lukin ona la, soweli Tokije li lape e poki lon ma lon tenpo tu."
,"He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing.—""Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!"" said Benjamin Bunny.",,"toki pi soweli Monsiko la, soweli Tokije li tawa e lawa ona sama toki pona, li nasin e lukin pi soweli Monsiko kepeken tawa luka, li mu mute a tan pilin musi.—soweli Penjamin li toki: ""soweli Pita, o tawa, o tawa wawa; ona li wile seli e soweli lili tawa moku; o wawa e tawa!"""
,"They climbed up and up;—""He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping out of the hole."" ""They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbours. Come on, Cousin Benjamin!""",,"ona tu li tawa sewi nena;—soweli Monsike li toki: ""ona li lon tomo. mi kama lukin e kute pimeja ona lon selo lupa."" soweli Pita li toki: ""soweli Monsiko en soweli Tokije li lon poka pi kiwen sama la, ona li wile ala e utala tan ona. o kama, soweli Penjamin o!"""
,"When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went cautiously. The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a crag, Mr. Tod had made one of his homes. It was at the top of a steep bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it. The rabbits crept up carefully, listening and peeping.",,"ona li kama lon ma pi kasi suli lon sewi pi nena Jasimani la, ona li lawa kepeken lukin mute, li wile ala e lukin tan soweli ike. kasi suli li lon kulupu kiwen. lon poka pi sinpin kiwen pi anpa mute la, tomo wan pi soweli Lisa li lon; tomo li lon sewi pi nena ma lili. kiwen en kasi kiwen anpa li len lili e ona. soweli tu li kama kepeken wawa ala, li kute mute, li lukin mute."
," This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumble-down pig-stye. There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.",,"tomo li sama lupa pi anpa ma, li sama poki awen pi jan ike, li sama  poki jaki pi soweli jaki. sinpin awen li selo awen e lupa."
,"The setting sun made the window panes glow like red ﬂame; but the kitchen fire was not alight. It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.",,"suno li tawa lupa lukin la, kiwen lukin pi kule ala li kama loje sama seli; taso seli li lon ala poki seli lon insa pi tomo moku. soweli li lukin tawa lupa lukin la, palisa pi ken seli li lon insa pi poki seli."
,"Benjamin sighed with relief.",,"jan Penjamin li pana weka e kon tan weka pi pilin ike."
,"But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder. There was an immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern, and a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.",,"taso ijo li lon supa moku la, ni li kama sin e pilin ike ona. poki pan suli li jo ala. sitelen pi laso li lon selo insa anpa ona li sama ma kasi suli. ilo moku palisa suli pi weka moku en ilo moku jo pi weka moku en ilo pi utala moku li lon poka poki."
,"At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt-cellar, mustard and a chair—in short, preparations for one person's supper.",,"poka supa ante la, len supa li kama ala lon supa ale. kiwen supa moku en poki telo en ilo moku palisa en ilo moku jo en poki pi namako walo en poki pi ko jelo namako en supa monsi li lon kin—ale ni li pona tawa moku kama pi jan wan."
,"No person was to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.",,"jan ala li lon insa. soweli lili kin li lon ala. tomo moku li jo ala, li kalama ala. ilo tenpo li lon, taso ona li pali ala. soweli Pita en soweli Penjamin li sinpin e nena ona lon kiwen pi lupa lukin, li lukin tawa pimeja insa."
,"Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house. It was damp and smelly, and overgrown with thorns and briars.",,"ona li pini e lukin la, ona li tawa poka tomo ante. telo lili en kon jaki li lon. kasi kiwen ike en kasi pi ken utala li lon."
,"The rabbits shivered in their shoes.",,"pilin pi soweli tu li ike wawa."
,"Oh my poor rabbit babies! What a dreadful place; I shall never See them again! sighed Benjamin.",,"soweli Penjamin li mu ike: ""a, ike li lon soweli suwi mi! tomo ni li ike mute; mi kama ala lukin e ona lon tenpo kama a!"""
,"They crept up to the bedroom window. It was closed and bolted like the kitchen. But there were signs that this window had been recently open; the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmars upon the window-sill.",,"ona li tawa lupa lukin pi tomo lape. ona li ken ala open; sama lupa pi tomo moku. taso lukin la, lupa li kama open lon tenpo pini lili; nasa li lon len linja pipi; jaki pi sin mute li lon supa lon poka lupa, li tan noka."
,"The room inside was so dark that at first they could make out nothing; but they could hear a noise—a slow deep regular snoring grunt. And as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket.—""He has gone to bed in his boots,"" whispered Peter.",,"insa tomo li pimeja mute la, soweli li ken ala lukin lon tenpo open; taso ona li ken kute e kalama—e mu pi lape wawa. lukin ona li kama wawa lon pimeja la, ona li ken lukin e supa lape pi soweli Lisa. jan li lon ona, li len selo.—soweli Pita li toki kepeken kalama lili taso: ""ona li weka ala e poki len noka ona lon supa lape."""
," Benjamin, who was all of a twitter, pulled Peter off the window-sill.",,"ni li wawa e pilin pi soweli Penjamin la, ona li weka e soweli Pita tan lupa."
,"Tommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed. Nothing could be seen of the young family.",,"soweli Tokije li awen mu lape, li kalama mu mute lon tenpo pi sike mute lon supa lape pi soweli Lisa. soweli lili pi kute suli li lon ala tawa lukin."
,"The sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood. There were many unpleasant things lying about that had much better have been buried; rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors. It was a shocking place, and very dark.",,"suno li kama anpa la, waso pi tenpo pimeja li mu lon ma kasi. ijo jaki mute li lon ale. pilin la, ona ale o pona lon anpa ma taso; kiwen pi sijelo soweli en kiwen pi lawa soweli en noka waso en ijo ike ante li lon. ma ni li ma ike, li ma pimeja."
,"They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window. They tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a light.",,"soweli tu li kama sin lon poka sinpin tomo, li lukin tawa e kiwen awen tan lupa lukin pi tomo moku. ona li lukin insa e palisa lili ilo lon insa pi selo lupa; taso ni li ken ala. pimeja kin li ike e pali ni."
,"They sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.",,"ona li awen lon poka lupa, li toki pi kalama lili, li kute."
,"In half an hour the moon rose over the wood. It shone full and clear and cold, upon the house, amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window. But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen! The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a path of brightness across the dirty ﬂoor.",,"tenpo pi mute ala la mun li kama lon sewi pi ma kasi. ona suli li pana e suno walo lete lon tomo lon kiwen poka lon lupa pi tomo moku. a, taso soweli lili li kama ala lon lukin! suno mun li kama e suno lon ilo moku lon poki supa moku, li pana e nasin suno lon ma anpa jaki."
,"The light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace—a little iron door belonging to a brick oven of that old-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood.",,"suno li pana e lupa lili lon sinpin lon poka pi poki seli tawa lukin—lupa ni li kiwen suno, li tawa ilo tomo seli. ilo ni li tan tenpo pini suli, li ken seli tan palisa kili lili."
,"And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window the little door opposite shook in answer. The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!",,"tenpo ni la, soweli Pita en soweli Penjamin li kama sona e ijo sin: ona li luka tawa e kiwen lupa la, lupa ilo li tawa sama. kulupu pi soweli lili li lon a, li awen a, li lon ilo seli!"
,"Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.",,"soweli Penjamin li pilin pi pona wawa a. taso pona la, kalama pilin ona li pini ala e lape pi soweli Tokije. soweli lape li awen mu lape lon supa lape pi soweli Lisa."
,"But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery. They could not open the window; and although the young family was alive the little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not old enough to crawl.",,"taso sona sin ni li kama ala e pona mute. lupa li awen pini. soweli lili ale li moli ala, taso ona li sin mute li lili mute la, ona li ken ala kama weka tan ilo, li ken ala tawa mute."
,"After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel. They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank. They hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house; the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags.",,"soweli Pita en soweli Penjamin li toki mute pi kalama lili la, ona tu li wile pali e lupa nasin lon anpa ma."
," They dug and dug for hours. They could not tunnel straight on account of stones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor. Benjamin was on his back scratching upwards. Peter's claws were worn down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away. He called out that it was morning—sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods.",,"ona li pali li pali li pali lon tenpo mute. kiwen li lon la, nasin li ken ala sama palisa, taso pini pi tenpo pimaja la, ona li lon anpa pi tomo moku. soweli Penjamin li lon monsi ona, li lukin tawa sewi, li luka e ma sewi. luka pi soweli Pita li kama pakala la, ona li lon poka lupa, li weka e ma tan insa lupa. soweli Pita li toki e open pi tenpo suno—e kama suno, e kama pi kalama waso tan ma kasi anpa."
,"Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel shaking the sand from his ears; he cleaned his face with his paws. Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill. In the valley there was a sea of white mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.",,"soweli Penjamin li kama tan lupa pimeja, li tawa weka e ko ma tan kute ona; ona li telo luka e sinpin ona, li weka e jaki tan sinpin. tenpo li awen kama la, suno li awen kama, li awen kama seli lon sewi ni nena. noka nena la, kon li sama ko walo, li len lili e sewi jelo suno pi kasi suli."
,"Again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jay, followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!",,"mu waso utala sin li kama tan ma pi kon ko walo la, mu alasa pi soweli alasa kin li kama!"
,"Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely. They did the most foolish thing that they could have done. They rushed into their short new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's kitchen floor.",,"ni li nasa e soweli tu pi kute suli, li wawa nasa e pilin ona. ni la, ona li pali e ike: ona li tawa insa pi lupa pali ona, li len kepeken lupa ni lon pini lupa lon anpa ma pi tomo moku."
,"Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers. First he had been upset by breaking the plate. It was his own fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod. Then the midges had been very bad. And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs, two of them addled. Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.",,"soweli Lisa a li kama lon nena Jasimani, li pilin ike utala. tenpo open la, ona li pakala e kiwen supa moku. ni li pakala tan ona taso; taso kiwen supa li mani a, li kiwen supa pi wan awen taso tan mama mama pi soweli Lisa. tenpo ante la, pipi li ike e ona. tenpo kin la, ona li alasa e waso lon supa lape ona, li kama ala jo e waso. ike kin la, supa lape waso li jo e sike waso luka taso. ike ante kin la, sike tu li jaki. tenpo pimeja ni li ike tawa soweli Lisa."
,"As usual, when out of humour, he determined to move house. First he tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a dead fish near it. Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own.",,"ona li pilin musi ala sama tenpo ante la, ona li wile tawa tomo ante. open la, ona li tawa tomo lon poka telo, taso telo en kala moli li lon insa tomo. soweli telo li pana e kala moli tan pini moku. jaki pi soweli Lisa taso li pona tawa soweli Lisa."
,"He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger. No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as Tommy Brock.",,"ni la, ona li tawa sewi nena; pilin ike ona li kama ala pona tan lupa noka pi soweli Tokije. soweli Tokije taso li pana e lupa noka sama ni."
," Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to. He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently. It flew from tree to tree and scolded, warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation. Once when it flew screaming over his head Mr. Tod snapped at it, and barked.",,"soweli Lisa li utala e ma kepeken palisa ona, li pana e kon pi pilin utala; pilin ona li sona e ma pi soweli Tokije. waso mu kin li awen lon poka ona, li ike e pilin ona. waso li tawa tan sewi pi kasi wan tawa sewi pi kasi ante, li mu e ike kama e soweli alasa kama tawa soweli pi kute suli. waso li tawa lon sewi pi soweli Lisa lon tenpo wan la, soweli Lisa li lukin utala uta e ona, li mu utala tawa ona."
,"He approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key. He sniffed and his whiskers bristled. The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod had his doubts whether it was empty. He turned the rusty key in the lock; the rabbits below could hear it. Mr. Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.",,"ona li tawa tomo ona la, ona li tawa kepeken tenpo, li lukin lon poka ale. ona li jo e ilo open. ona li pilin e kon kepeken nena. linja suli li tawa lili lon sinpin ona. tomo li awen pini, taso pilin pi soweli Lisa la, jan li ken lon insa. ona li kepeken ilo open lon ilo awen lupa la, soweli tu pi kute suli li ken kute e ni. soweli Lisa li open e lupa kepeken tenpo, li tawa insa."
,"The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious. There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar, and his table-cloth, that he had left folded up in the dresser—all set out for supper (or breakfast)—without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.",,"soweli Lisa li lukin e ale lon tomo moku pi soweli Lisa la, soweli Lisa li pilin utala wawa. supa monsi pi soweli Lisa li lon. poki supa moku pi soweli Lisa li lon. ilo moku ona en ko jelo namako ona en poki ona pi namako walo li lon. len pi supa moku li lon kin. tenpo pini la, ona li awen e len ni lon poki pona—taso tenpo ni la, ona li lon supa moku sama tenpo moku—a, ni li ken tan soweli Tokije taso."
,"There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit.",,"kon sin li tan ma, li tan soweli Tokije. pona la, kon pi Tokije li wawa, li len e kon tan soweli lili pi kute suli tawa nena."
,"But what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise, a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.",,"taso ijo wan li suli e pilin pi soweli Lisa. kalama li lon, li kama lon sike tenpo, li mu lape wawa, li tan supa ona a."
,"He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door. Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry. His whiskers bristled and his coat-collar stood on end with rage.",,"ona li lukin tawa tomo lape ona. lupa pi tomo lape li seli lili taso la, ni li ken e lukin. tenpo ni la, ona li tawa monsi, li tawa weka tan tomo ona. linja suli ona li tawa lon sinpin ona. linja lon monsi lawa ona li tawa sewi tan pilin utala."
,"For the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the house, and retreating hurriedly out again. By degrees he ventured further in—right into the bedroom. When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury. But when he was inside—he did not like the look of Tommy Brock's teeth.",,"tenpo li tawa la, soweli Lisa li awen kama lili lon insa tomo, li kama weka tan tomo. kama ale la, ona li suli e kama insa—li tawa tomo lape kin. ona li lon poka tomo la, ona li utala e ma tan pilin utala wawa. taso ona li lon insa la—kiwen uta pi soweli Tokije li ike mute tawa ona."
,"He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear. He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.",,"soweli Tokije li lape lon monsi ona la, uta ona li awen open. uta li awen lon sewi sama pilin musi. ona li mu lape awen, li mu lape lon lape suwi; taso lukin wan li pini ale ala."
,"Mr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom. Twice he brought in his walking-stick, and once he brought in the coal-scuttle. But he thought better of it, and took them away.",,"soweli Lisa li tawa tomo lape, li tan tomo lape. tenpo tu la, ona li jo e palisa ona pi pona tawa. tenpo wan la, ona li jo e ilo jo pi kiwen seli tan poki seli. taso tenpo ale la, ona li ante e pilin ona, li poka e ni."
," When he came back after removing the coal-scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep. He was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.",,"ona li weka e ilo jo kiwen la, soweli Tokije li lape lon poka ona; taso lape ona li kama wawa. pilin ona li wile awen lon tenpo mute. soweli Lisa li ike ala e pilin ona. ona li pilin pona la, wile ona li kama ala e tawa lon ona."
,"Mr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes-line. He stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the snores. They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.",,"soweli Lisa li kama sin lon tomo lape la, ona li jo e linja pi awen len. tenpo lili la, ona li lukin e soweli Tokije, li kute pona e mu lape. mu ale ni li kalama wawa, taso mu li awen lon nasin sama."
,"Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window. It creaked; he turned round with a jump. Tommy Brock, who had opened one eye—shut it hastily. The snores continued.",,"soweli Lisa li poka e monsi ona tawa lape, li weka e awen tan lupa lukin. lupa li pana e kalama; soweli Tokije li pilin wawa tan ni, li kama lukin tawa supa lape kepeken tenpo ala. soweli Tokije li open e lukin wan lon tenpo lili pini la—ona li pini wawa e lukin lon tenpo ni a. mu lape li awen sin."
,"Mr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather difficult (because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom). He opened the window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window-sill. The rest of the line, with a hook at the end, remained in his hand.",,"pali pi soweli Lisa li nasa, li wile e pali namako mute (tan ni: supa lape li lon insa mute pi tomo lape, li poka e lupa tawa e lupa  lukin lon tomo lape). soweli Lisa li open lili e lupa, li tawa e linja len mute tawa lupa. ni la, lili linja li awen lon insa. pini linja la, sike awen ilo li lon. soweli Lisa li awen jo e pini linja ni."
,"Tommy Brock snored conscientiously. Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for a minute; then he left the room again.",,"soweli Tokije li awen nasin e mu lape ona. soweli Lisa li kama sewi sin, li lukin e soweli lon tenpo lili. ni la, ona li tawa sin tan tomo lape."
,"Tommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned. There was a noise outside the window. Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.",,"soweli Tokije li open e lukin ona tu, li lukin e linja, li sewi musi e uta ona. kalama li kama tan lupa lukin. soweli Tokije li pini wawa e lukin ona."
,"Mr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the house. On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow. If he had had any idea who was inside it he would have pulled them out quickly.",,"soweli Lisa li tawa tan lupa lon poka sinpin tomo, li tawa poa monsi tomo. tawa ni la, ona li kama lon lupa nasin pali tan soweli pi kute suli. ona li sona e lon insa pi soweli tu la, ona li alasa e soweli ni, taso ona li sona ala."
,"His foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin; but, fortunately, he thought that it was some more of Tommy Brock's work.",,"noka pi soweli Lisa li kama lon insa pi lupa pali, li kama lon poka pi soweli tu, taso pona la, pilin ona la, pali lupa ni li tan soweli Tokije taso."
,"He took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and then tied the rope to a tree.",,"soweli Lisa li kama jo e linja tan lupa, li kute lon tenpo lili, li awen wawa e linja lon kasi kiwen."
,"Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window. He was puzzled.",,"soweli Tokije li lukin e ni tan lupa kepeken lukin wan taso. kama ni li nasa tawa ona."
," Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.",,"soweli Lisa li kama e poki telo suli tan open telo, li tawa e ni tawa tomo moku, li tawa e ni tawa tomo lape, li wile e wawa mute lon pali ni."
,"Tommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.",,"soweli Tokije li mu lape wawa."
,"Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook—hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock. The snores were almost apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.",,"soweli Lisa li pana e poki telo lon poka pi supa lape, li kama jo e sike pi pini linja—li awen lon tenpo lili, li lukin e soweli Tokije. mu lape li sama utala; taso sewi uta musi li suli sama ala."
,"Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead. His legs were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.",,"soweli Lisa li kama lon sewi pi supa monsi lon sinpin lawa pi supa lape. noka ona li lon poka pi soweli Tokije la, kiwen uta kin li lon poka noka ike."
,"He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.",,"ona li kama e linja lon sewi, li awen e sike ilo pi pini linja lon palisa sewi pi supa lape. tenpo ante la, len li ken awen lon ni, li ken len e poka pi poki lape."
,"(Mr. Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house being unoccupied. So was the counterpane. Tommy Brock was covered with a blanket only.) Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!",,"(soweli Lisa li weka tan tomo la, len poka ni lon ala sewi pi supa lape, li lon insa pi poki len. len ante kin pi supa lape li lon insa poki. len pi wawa ala li len e soweli Tokije.) soweli Lisa li lon supa monsi pi ken pakala la, ona li lukin tawa anpa, li lukin e soweli Tokije. lukin a la, soweli Tokije li ken lape wawa a!"
,"It seemed as though nothing would waken him—not even the flapping rope across the bed.",,"lukin la, ijo ala li ken kama pini e lape ona—linja li lon sewi ona la, ni kin li ken ala pini e lape. lukin la, ni li lon."
,"Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavoured to get up again with the pail of water. He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath, worked by a string, through the window",,"soweli Lisa li kama anpa tan supa monsi, li wile kama sin, li wile kama e poki telo suli. ona li wile awen e poki telo lon sike ilo lon pini linja lon sewi pi soweli Tokije, li wile pana e telo lete tawa soweli Tokije tan linja tan poka lupa ante."
,"But, naturally, being a thin-legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)—he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope. He very nearly overbalanced himself.",,"taso, lon la, noka ona li wawa ala. ona li ken pana e wile ike, li jo e linja suli pi kule ma lon sinpin—taso ona li ken ala sewi wawa e poki wawa tawa sike ilo tawa linja. ni li ken anpa pakala e ona."
,"The snores became more and more apoplectic. One of Tommy Brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.",,"mu lape li kama utala mute. noka wan pi soweli Tokije li kama tawa mute lon anpa len, taso ona li awen lape pona."
,"Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident. After considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug. The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over the head of Tommy Brock.",,"soweli Lisa en poki suli wawa li kama tan supa monsi lon ala pakala. ona li pilin e kama kepeken tenpo la, ona li pana e telo tawa poki telo supa e telo tawa poki telo pi supa moku kin. poki wawa li jo ala e telo la, ni li wawa ike ala tawa soweli Lisa; ona li sewi e poki wawa pi jo ala tawa sewi pi soweli Tokije"
,"Surely there never was such a sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down, down and up on the chair.",,"lukin la, soweli Tokije li lape pi pona nanpa wan a! soweli Lisa li tawa sewi, li tawa anpa, li lon supa monsi, li tan supa."
,"As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once he fetched a milk jug and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees. The pail got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. Occasionally a drop splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never moved,—except in one eye.",,"ona li ken ala sewi wawa e telo ale lon poki wawa la, ona li pana e telo tawa poki wawa kepeken poki telo moku kepeken ilo moku lupa. poki telo wawa li jo, li jo, li jo e telo, li kama tawa tan poka tawa poka. tenpo la, telo lili li kama tawa anpa, taso soweli Tokije li awen mu lape, li tawa ala—taso lukin wan ona li tawa."
," At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete. The pail was full of water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across the window-sill to the tree outside;",,"pini la, soweli Lisa li kama pali e ale pi wile ona. poki li jo e telo ale; jo wawa e poki lon sewi pi supa lape, li tawa lupa tawa kasi kiwen la ona li sama palisa tan jo anpa."
,"It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort, said Mr. Tod.",,"soweli Lisa li toki: ""ni li pana e jaki mute lon tomo lape mi; taso mi wile lape lon supa ni la, pali pi weka jaki o lon."""
,"Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. He went out of the house, shutting the front door. The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.",,"soweli Lisa li lukin e soweli Tokije lon pini lukin, li tawa tan tomo lape. ona li tawa tan tomo kin, li pini e lupa. soweli tu li lon lupa pali la, ona li kute e noka lon sewi ma."
,"He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock—",,"soweli Lisa li tawa poka monsi tomo, li wile ken e tawa linja, li wile e telo mute lon soweli Tokije tan poki telo suli—"
,"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise, said Mr. Tod.",,"ona li toki: ""mi wile pini e lape ona kepeken kama ike a."""
,"The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also—grinning immensely.",,"soweli Lisa li tawa tan tomo lape la, soweli Tokije li tawa wawa tan supa lon tenpo sama; ona li alasa e len sijelo lape pi soweli Lisa, li sike e len, li pana e sike len lon anpa pi poki telo suli, li pana ala e ona sama lon anpa poki, li tawa kin tan tomo lape—li sewi musi e uta ona."
,"He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.",,"ona li tawa tomo moku, li open e seli, li seli e poki pi telo seli. tenpo ni awen la, ona li pana ala e wile seli tawa soweli lili pi kute suli."
,"When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth. He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.",,"soweli Lisa li lon kasi kiwen la, ona li kama lukin e ni: wawa pi poki telo li wawa mute e linja, li kiwen e linja la, ni li ike e weka linja tan kasi. soweli li ken ala kepeken luka tawa weka linja la, ona li kepeken uta ona. ona li moku e linja lon tenpo mute. pini la, linja li kama tawa wawa, li kepeken wawa tawa la, linja li kama utala e soweli, li pakala e pilin lon kiwen uta, li tawa monsi e soweli, li tawa anpa e soweli."
," Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a pail rolling over and over.",,"insa tomo la, kalama wawa poki en kalama wawa telo li lon. kalama pi tawa poki li awen."
,"But no screams. Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened attentively. Then he peeped in at the window. The water was dripping from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.",,"taso kalama soweli li lon ala. ni li nasa tawa soweli Lisa; ona li awen kepeken kalama ala, li kute mute. pini la, ona li lukin tawa lupa lukin. telo li lon supa, li tan supa. poki suli li kama tawa sinpin poka."
,"In the middle of the bed, under the blanket, was a wet something—much flattened in the middle, where the pail had caught it (as it were across the tummy). Its head was covered by the wet blanket, and it was not snoring any longer.",,"insa supa la, ijo telo li lon anpa len—li kama lipu lili lon insa tan tawa anpa pi poki wawa. (sijelo la, ni li ken insa.) lawa pi ijo ni li lon anpa len, li pana ala e mu lape lon tenpo ni."
,"There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop, drip, of water trickling from the mattress.",,"ijo li tawa ala. telo taso li tawa tan supa kepeken mu lili lon anpa lon anpa lon anpa ma."
,"Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.",,"soweli Lisa li lukin kepeken tenpo mute; lukin ona li suno telo tan lukin wawa."
,"Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window; but the bundle never moved.",,"pini la, ona li tawa musi, li pilin wawa la, ona li luka kalama e lupa; taso ijo lon anpa len li tawa ala."
,"Yes—there was no doubt about it—it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!",,"ni li lon a—ni taso li ken—kama ni la, ale li kama pona mute tawa wile ona a; poki li kama utala e soweli Tokije la, soweli Tokije li moli, li moli wawa a!"
,"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug. I will bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun, said Mr. Tod.",,"soweli Lisa li toki: ""a, mi wile anpa e soweli ike ni lon lupa pi pali ona. mi wile tawa e supa lape mi. suno o seli pi weka telo e len suli ona."
,"I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach. And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a hot-water bottle.",,"mi wile telo e len pi supa moku. suno o weka e kule e jaki tan len ni. len lili pi supa lape o kama telo ala lon kon tawa; supa lape la jaki o weka mute a. ilo seli o kon mute e supa lape. poki pi seli telo o seli pona e ona."
,"I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the smell. I must have a disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur.",,"mi wile kama e ko suwi pi weka jaki, e ko wawa pi weka jaki, e ko ante mute pi weka jaki; telo pi weka jaki en ilo pi weka jaki o lon. namako pi weka pipi o lon; kiwen pi kon pona o weka e kon jaki. weka jaki mute o kama. ken la mi o seli e kiwen ko pi kon wawa."""
,"He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen—""First I will arrange the hole—then I will drag out that person in the blanket. . . .""",,"ona li tawa lon poka tomo ale, li kama jo e ilo ma pi lupa pali tan tomo moku—""tenpo open la, mi wile pali e lupa tawa soweli—ni li pini la, mi tawa e soweli moli kepeken len pi supa lape. mi kama weka e ona tan tomo a. . . ."""
,"He opened the door. . . .",,"ona li open e lupa. . . ."
,"Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from Mr. Tod's tea-pot into Mr. Tod's tea-cup. He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.",,"soweli Tokije li awen lon supa moku pi soweli Lisa, li kama e telo seli tan poki pi telo seli lon poki telo lili pi soweli Lisa. telo ala li lon soweli Tokije. ona li sewi musi e uta, li pana wawa e poki telo e telo seli a tawa soweli Lisa kama."
," Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen. To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.",,"ni la, soweli Lisa li tawa soweli Tokije. ona tu li utala lon poka pi kiwen moku pakala, li utala mute lon tomo moku. soweli pi kute suli li lon anpa pi tomo moku, li pakala e supa la, kalama ni li sama pakala ma lon lawa ona."
,"They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.",,"ona li kama tan lupa, li tawa poka kiwen lon poka pi kasi kiwen anpa, li kute lon pilin pi wawa ala."
,"Inside the house the racket was fearful. The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.",,"insa tomo la, utala kalama li ike. soweli lili li lon insa pi ilo seli la, ona li kama pini e lape ona tan utala, li pilin ike tan ni; ken la awen insa poki ona li pona lon utala ni."
,"Everything was upset except the kitchen table.",,"ijo pi sama ale li kama ike, taso supa moku li awen."
,"And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender. The crockery was smashed to atoms.",,"ijo pi sama ale li kama pakala, taso poki seli li awen. kiwen supa moku ale en poki ale li lili wawa tan pakala utala."
,"The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash, and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.",,"supa monsi ale en lupa lukin li pakala. ilo tenpo li kama anpa pakala. linja suli pi kule ma li lon ma, li tan sinpin pi soweli Lisa."
,"The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the cannisters fell off the shelf; the kettle fell off the hob. Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry jam.",,"poki kasi suwi li kama anpa tan sewi pi poki seli. poki pi awen moku li kama anpa tan supa sewi awen; poki pi telo seli li kama anpa tan supa seli. noka pi soweli Tokije li kama lon poki pi ko kili suwi loje."
,"And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.",,"telo pi seli mute li kama tan poki pi telo seli, li tawa palisa monsi pi soweli Lisa."
,"When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the door.",,"poki pi telo seli li kama anpa la, soweli Tokije li awen sewi musi e uta, li lon sewi pi soweli Lisa lon tenpo sama. ona li tawa e soweli Lisa lon ma sama ijo sike, li tawa e soweli, li tawa e soweli, li kama e soweli tawa lupa."
,"Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks. There will never be any love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.",,"ni la, kalama en utala li awen lon weka tomo; ona tu li tawa sike lon nena ma lili, li tawa sike lon nena, li tawa sike lon noka nena, li sijelo e kiwen. tenpo ala la, olin li ken kama tan soweli ni tu."
," As soon as the coast was clear, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out of the bushes.",,"ike li weka la, soweli Pita en soweli Penjamin li kama tan kasi anpa kiwen."
,"Now for it! Run in, Cousin Benjamin! Run in and get them! while I watch the door.",,"""o tawa! lon tenpo ni! o tawa insa kepeken wawa! o jo e ona! mi lukin e kama ike."""
,"But Benjamin was frightened—",,"taso soweli Penjamin li pilin ike wawa—"
,"Oh; oh! they are coming back!",,"""ike a; ike! ona li kama sin!"""
,"No they are not.",,"""ona li ni ala."""
,"Yes they are!",,"""ona li ni kin a!"""
,"What dreadful bad language! I think they have fallen down the stone quarry.",,"""sina wile toki ike anu seme! pilin mi la, ona li kama anpa pakala lon ma pi pali kiwen."""
,"Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him—",,"awen la, soweli Penjamin li pilin wawa ala. awen la, soweli Pita li luka tawa e ona—"
,"Be quick, it's all right. Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that he won't miss them.",,"""o kepeken tenpo lili. ale li pona. suli la, o pini e lupa ilo lon pini. sina ni la, ona li ken ala lukin e kama ante tan mi."""
,"Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!",,"lon la, ijo mute a li kama lon tomo moku pi soweli Lisa!"
,"At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.",,"tomo pi kulupu soweli la, pona ala li lon."
,"After quarreling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy. The day passed heavily.",,"soweli Lawako en soweli Penjakin li toki utala lon moku lon pini pi tenpo suno la, ona tu li lape ike, li toki utala sin lon moku lon open pi tenpo suno kama. soweli Penjakin li kama e jan ante lon tomo la, ona li ken ala awen toki e ante lon tenpo ni; taso ona li wile ala pana e sona tawa wile sona pi soweli Lawako. tenpo suno li tawa la, pilin ike li lon."
,"Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair. Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco. She had been having a complete turn out and spring-cleaning, to relieve her feelings. She had just finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was wondering anxiously what she would do next.",,
,"In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amidst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust. He opened the oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. He lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.",,
,"I've got them! Can we get away? Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?",,
,"Peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.",,
,"Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down Bull Banks, half carrying, half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty bump over the grass. They reached home safely, and burst into the rabbit hole.",,
," Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. They soon recovered.",,
,"A new long pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to Mr. Bouncer. He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.",,
,"Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner. Then Peter and Benjamin told their story—but they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.",,
