,"ONCE upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.",,"tenpo wan la, akesi li lon. nimi ona li Kalasa. tomo ona li lon telo, li poka e kasi pi supa telo, li lon selo telo."
,"THE water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.",,"monsi tomo en tomo pi awen moku la, telo li lon."
,"But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!",,"taso akesi Kalasa li pilin pona tan telo lon noka; toki ike li kama ala tawa ona tan ni. sijelo ona li kama ala ike tan ni."
,"HE was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond—",,"ona li pilin pona a. ona li lukin tawa ma, li lukin e kama telo tan sewi, e anpa telo lon telo anpa—"
,"IWILL get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner, said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. ""If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton. The Alderman, however, eats salad.""",,"akesi Kalasa li toki: ""mi kama jo e pipi ko pi kama kala. mi tawa alasa kala. mi alasa e kala moku pona. mi kama alasa e kala luka wan anu kala pi mute suli ante la, mi kama e akesi pona mi Majunanpa e akesi pona mi Omekapo. taso akesi Majunanpa li moku e kasi taso."""
,"MR. JEREMY put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.",,"akesi Kalasa li kepeken len awen pi weka telo, e poki noka awen pi weka telo. ona li jo e ilo alasa ona, e poki ona. ona li tawa poki tawa ona , li tawa kepeken tawa sewi suli."
,"THE boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.",,"poki tawa ona li sike pona, li laso sama kasi poka. linja li awen e ona lon kasi lon telo insa."
,"MR. JEREMY took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. ""I know a good place for minnows,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.",,"akesi Kalasa li kama jo e palisa kasi, li tawa e poki kepeken palisa. ona li toki: ""mi sona e lon telo pona tawa kala moku pona."""
,"MR. JEREMY stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.",,"akesi Kalama li insa e palisa lon ko ma, li linja awen e poki lon ona."
,"Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.",,"ni li pini la, akesi li lape e noka ona e monsi ona, li nasin e ilo alasa ona. ilo la, palisa li tan kasi anpa. kin la, linja li linja walo suli wan tan soweli suli tawa, li sama kon tawa lukin. akesi li awen e pipi pi kama kala lon linja. linja la, pipi ko ni li tawa."
,"THE rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.",,"telo li awen kama tan sewi, li kama lon monsi akesi. akesi li awen lukin e ilo ona lon tenpo suli."
,"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch, said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.",,"akesi Kalasa li toki: ""ni li kama e pilin lape. mi wile moku."""
,"HE punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.",,"ona li tawa sin e poki, li tawa kasi lon telo, li open e poki moku."
,"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over, said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.",,"akesi Kalasa li toki: ""mi moku e pan pipi. telo li pini e kama anpa la, mi awen."""
,"AGREAT big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes.",,"pipi telo suli li kama lon anpa ona, li luka kiwen e poki noka ona wan."
,"Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.",,"akesi Kalasa li lili e noka ona, li weka e noka tan pipi, li awen moku e pan."
,"ONCE or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.",,"tenpo la, kalama en tawa en kalama en tawa li kama tan poka telo, li pana e kalama kasi, e kalama telo."
,"I trust that is not a rat, said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; ""I think I had better get away from here.""",,"akesi Kalasa li pilin e ni: ""ni li soweli lili ala. a, mi o tawa tan ni."""
,"MR. JEREMY shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!",,"akesi Kalasa li tawa lili sin e poki tawa, li anpa e moku pi kama kala. tenpo lili taso la, jo li kama lon moku! poki li kama tawa wawa a."
,"A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose! cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.",,"akesi Kalasa li kalama: ""kala moku! kala pona! mi jo! mi jo!"""
,"BUT what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!",,"taso ike li kama! ni li kala moku pona ala. ni li kala lili ala! ni li kala Kipisike! palisa lili utala li lon selo sewi ona!"
,"THE stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.",,
,"AND a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher.",,
,"AND while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat—sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water—a much worse thing happened; a really frightful thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh!",,
,"AGREAT big enormous trout came up—kerpflop-p-p-p! with a splash—and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, ""Ow! Ow! Ow!""—and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!",,
,"BUT the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.",,
,"MR. JEREMY bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.",,
,"HE scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.",,
,"WHAT a mercy that was not a pike! said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. ""I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!""",,
,"HE put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.",,
,"SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat,",,
,"AND Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.",,
,"AND instead of a nice dish of minnows—they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but I think it must have been nasty!",,
