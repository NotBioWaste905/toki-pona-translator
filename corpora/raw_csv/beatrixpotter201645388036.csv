,"THIS is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!",,,"ni li soweli Mope, ona li pilin e ni: ona li kute e soweli lili!"
,"THIS is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten.",,,"ni li soweli lili. ona li lukin tan poki li toki musi tan soweli Mope. ona li pilin ike ala tan soweli Mope."
,"THIS is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head.",,,"ni li soweli Mope. ona li tawa sewi lon tenpo ike; ona li ike ala e soweli lili li ike e lawa ona."
,"SHE thinks it is a very hard cupboard!",,,"soweli Mope li pilin e ni: poki li sama kiwen!"
,"THE Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.",,,"soweli lili li lukin e soweli Mope tan sewi poki."
,"MISS MOPPET ties up her head in a duster, and sits before the fire.",,,"soweli Mope li len e lawa ona, li awen lon seli."
,"THE Mouse thinks she is looking very ill. He comes sliding down the bell-pull.",,,"soweli lili li pilin e ni: soweli Mope li pilin ike. soweli lili li anpa tan linja."
,"MISS MOPPET looks worse and worse. The Mouse comes a little nearer.",,,"soweli Mope li ike lukin mute. soweli lili li kama lili."
,"MISS MOPPET holds her poor head in her paws, and looks at him through a hole in the duster. The Mouse comes very close.",,,"soweli Mope li jo e lawa lon luka ona, li lukin e soweli lili lon sike ala len. soweli lili li kama mute."
,"AND then all of a sudden—Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!",,,"tenpo lili la - soweli Mope li tawa sewi lon soweli lili!"
,"AND because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet—Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.",,,"soweli lili li musi e soweli Mope la - soweli Mope li pilin e ni: ona li musi e soweli lili; ni li pona ala a tan soweli Mope."
,"SHE ties him up in the duster, and tosses it about like a ball.",,,"soweli Mope li len e soweli lili, li musi e ona sama sike."
,"BUT she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it—there was no Mouse!",,,"taso soweli Mope li kama sona ala e sike ala len; ona li len ala e ona - soweli lili li lon ala!"
,"HE has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard!",,,"soweli lili li kama weka; li tawa musi lon sewi poki!"
