,"Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!",,"tenpo wan la, soweli li lon, li mute pi awen tenpo, li soweli Mamako. li soweli alasa, li soweli pi kalama noka ala, li soweli tomo. ona li mama kin, li pilin mute e pali mama. soweli lili ona li awen kama weka. soweli lili li weka sin la, ona li pali e nasa ike lon tenpo sin a!"
,"On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.",,"tenpo suno wan la, soweli Mamako li nasin e ni: ona li wile awen e soweli lili lon insa pi supa poki."
,"She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.",,"ona li kama jo e soweli Puwan e soweli Suwile, taso ona li awen alasa e soweli Nija."
,"Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.",,"soweli Mamako li tawa sewi tomo, li tawa anpa tomo, li tawa ale tomo, li mu e nimi pi soweli Nija. ona li lukin e insa pi poki awen moku lon anpa pi nasin sewi anpa, li lukin e tomo lape pi jan tawa. tomo ni li ken pona tawa jan kama pi tomo ante. len li awen e supa ale tan jaki. ona li tawa sewi tomo, li lukin lon anpa pi selo tomo sewi, taso soweli Nija li lon ala ni kin."
,"It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night—especially cheese and bacon.",,"tomo li tomo pi tenpo mute mute, li jo e supa poki mute, e nasin mute. insa sinpin li wawa suli sama suli jan. kalama nasa li tan insa sinpin la, ni li ken sama nasin lili lon insa sinpin. lon la, lupa lili li lon noka sinpin mute. lon la, ijo—en ko moku kin—li kama weka lon tenpo pimeja."
,"Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully.",,"nasin pali pi soweli Mamako li kama nasa, li kama nasa. soweli li mu ike."
," While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.",,"mama soweli li lon ale tomo la, soweli Puwan en soweli Suwile li kama pali e nasa."
,"The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.",,"lupa pi supa poki li pini awen ala la, soweli li open e lupa, li kama tan supa poki."
," They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.",,"lili la, ona li tawa ko pan. ko li kama suli lon insa pi poki moku supa lon poka seli."
,"They patted it with their little soft paws—""Shall we make dear little muffins?"" said Mittens to Moppet.",,"ona li noka suwi lili e ko—soweli Suwile li toki tawa soweli Puwan: ""mi wile ala wile pali e pan suwi lili?"""
," But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.",,"taso tenpo pi ni sama la, luka li kalama e sinpin lupa. ni la, soweli Puwan li kama tawa insa poki lon insa pi ko walo tan wawa pilin."
," Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.",,"soweli Suwile li tawa tomo pi awen telo, li len e sijelo ona lon insa poki pi jo ala. supa poki sama la, poki pali pi telo walo mama li lon."
,"The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast.",,"kama li soweli pi tomo poka, li soweli Lenja; ona li wile kama jo e ko nasa pi pali moku tan soweli Mamako."
,"Mr. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully—""Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,"" said Tabitha, shedding tears. ""I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him."" She wiped her eyes with her apron.",,"soweli Mamako li kama tawa anpa tomo, li mu ike—""o kama, soweli Lenja pi kulupu sama o. a, o kama, o lape e monsi! ike la, kama ike li lon mi, soweli Lenja o."" ona li pana e telo tan lukin. ""soweli lili mi Nija li kama weka tan mi; pilin ike mi la, soweli pi lili mute ala li jo e ona."" ona li len luka weka e telo lon lukin."
,"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?",,"""ona li soweli lili ike, soweli sama Mamako o; mi kama tawa tenpo sina pi telo kasi seli la, ona li musi kepeken linja tan len lawa mi a. sina alasa e ona lon seme?"""
,"All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to have an unruly family! said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.",,"soweli Mamako li toki: ""lon ale tomo a! soweli pi lili ala li mute ike tawa mi. a, kulupu mi li nasa la, ni li wawa ike tawa mi!"""
," ""I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too! What is all that soot in the fender?""",,"""soweli pi lili ala li ken ala nasa e pilin wawa mi; mi ken alasa e soweli lili sina lon poka sina; mi ken utala kin e ona sama sina tan ike ona! a, ko pimeja ni li seme lon sinpin pi poki seli?"""
," ""The chimney wants sweeping—Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby—now Moppet and Mittens are gone!",,"""lupa sewi li wile e weka jaki—a, pakala, soweli Lenja o—soweli Puwan en soweli Suwile li weka kin!"
,"They have both got out of the cupboard!",,"ona tu li kama tan supa poki!"""
,"Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella and they rummaged in cupboards. They even fetched a candle and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.",,"soweli Lenja en soweli Mamako li open e alasa wawa sin lon ale tomo. ona li lukin e anpa pi supa lape kepeken ilo awen pi soweli Lenja, li luka e ijo mute lon insa pi supa poki mute. ona li kama kin e palisa seli suno, li lukin lon insa pi poki len lon anpa pi selo tomo sewi. ona li kama ala pini pona e alasa, taso tenpo wan la, kalama wawa li pini e lupa lon weka. tenpo sama la, kalama noka li anpa lon nasin pi tawa anpa."
,"Yes, it is infested with rats, said Tabitha tearfully. ""I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat—an enormous old rat—Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.",,"soweli Mamako li toki pi pilin ike: ""ike lon la, soweli pi lili ala li mute jaki lon tomo ni. alasa la, mi kama jo e ona luka tu pi lili tenpo tan lupa sinpin lon monsi pi tomo moku. mi en soweli lili mi li kama moku e ona lon tenpo pi esun ala. tenpo wan la, mi kama lukin e mama mije ona—soweli Lenja o, ona li sike suli a. mi wile kama noka wawa e ona la, ona li kama e kiwen uta tawa mi, li tawa weka lon lupa ona."""
,"The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby, said Tabitha.",,"ona li awen toki: ""soweli jaki ni pi lili ala li nasa e lawa mi, soweli Lenja o."""
," Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen.",,"soweli Lenja en soweli Mamako li alasa, li alasa, li alasa. ona tu li kama kute e kalama pi tawa sike lon sewi tomo. taso ona li kama ala lukin."
," They returned to the kitchen. ""Here's one of your kittens at least,"" said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.",,"ona li kama sin lon tomo moku. soweli Lenja li kama toki: ""a, pona la, soweli sina wan li lon"" ona li jo weka e soweli Puwan tan poki pi ko walo."
,"They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She seemed to be in a terrible fright.",,"soweli suli tu li weka luka e walo ko tan soweli lili, li pana e ona lon supa ma. lukin la, ike li kama lon pilin pi soweli lili."
,"Oh! Mother, Mother, said Moppet, ""there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!""",,"soweli Puwan li toki: ""mama o, mama o, a, soweli jaki meli pi mute tenpo li kama lon tomo moku ni. ona li kama weka jo e ko pan lili!"""
,"The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!",,"soweli suli tu li lukin e poki ko. lon la, linja lupa lili li lon ko tan palisa luka. ko lili li weka tan ko ale a!"
,"Which way did she go, Moppet?",,"""soweli Puwan o, ona li tawa seme?"""
,"But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.",,"taso soweli Puwan li kama ala sin e lukin lon selo poki tan pilin ike ona."
,"Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search.",,"soweli Lenja en soweli Mamako li awen e ona lili lon poka lon lukin la, ona li awen alasa."
," They went into the dairy.",,"ona li tawa tomo pi awen telo."
,"The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.",,"sin la ona li kama lukin e soweli Suwile lon poki wan pi telo ala."
," They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out.",,"ona li anpa e poki la, soweli Suwile li kama tan poki."
,"Oh, Mother, Mother! said Mittens—",,"soweli Suwile li toki: ""a, mama o, mama o!—"
,"Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy—a dreadful 'normous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling pin.",,"a, mama o, mama o, a, soweli jaki mije li kama lon tomo awen ni. ona li sike suli a, mama o; ona li kama weka jo e ko moku jelo e ilo palisa pi pali sike."""
,"Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.",,"soweli Lenja en soweli Mamako li lukin e ona sama tu."
,"A rolling pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas! exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.",,"soweli Mamako li kalama: ""ilo en ko anu seme! a, ike li tawa soweli lili mi!"" ona li tawa sewi e luka."
,"A rolling pin? said Ribby. ""Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?""",,"soweli Lenja li toki: ""ilo palisa pi pali sike anu seme? a, mi lukin e poki lon sewi tomo lon sewi tomo la, mi kama kute e tawa sike anu seme?"""
,"Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.",,"sin la, soweli Lenja en soweli Mamako li tawa sewi tomo kepeken wawa. lon la, kalama pi tawa sike li awen lon supa anpa pi sewi tomo."
," ""This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,"" said Ribby. ""We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw.""",,"soweli Lenja li toki: ""ni li suli ike, soweli Mamako o. soweli Pela o kepeken ilo pi pana pakala lon supa anpa ni."""
," Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.",,"sina wile sona e kama lon soweli Nija la, sina wile sona e ike tan tawa lon lupa sewi pi kon seli lon tomo pi tenpo mute la, sina wile sona e kama lon sona nasin ala lon soweli pi lili ala la, o kute e ni:"
,"Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.",,"soweli Nija li wile ala awen lon poki lon supa oki. ona li lukin e tawa weka pi mama ona tan pali pi pan suwi la, ona li wile weka tan lukin."
,"He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.",,"ona li alasa e wan pona pi len ken, li kama awen lukin e lupa pi kon seli."
,"The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fire-place.",,"seli li kama open lon tenpo lili taso, li seli mute ala; taso kon walo wawa li kama tan palisa kasi tan seli. soweli Nija li kama lon selo pi poki seli, li lukin tawa sewi. poka ni li poka seli pona."
,"The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.",,"lupa sewi pi kon seli li suli pona lon tawa pi jan suli. ni la, lupa li suli a tawa soweli lili Nija."
," He jumped right up into the fire-place, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs.",,"ona li tawa sewi lon poka pi poki seli, li kama awen tawa pona lon palisa sewi awen pi poki telo."
," Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.",,"soweli Nija li kama e tawa sewi ante lon palisa, li kama lon sinpin lon sewi lon insa pi lupa kon. ko pimeja li kama anpa tan ni."
,"Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fire-place down below. He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.",,"soweli Nija li pana wawa e kon ike, li kon ike e kon walo; ona li ken kute e kama seli lon palisa kasi lon anpa seli. ona li kama e wile pi tawa sewi, e wile pi weka tomo, e wile lon sewi pi selo tomo, e wile pi alasa waso."
,"I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.",,"""mi ken ala kama sin lon nasin mi pi tenpo pini. mi kama anpa sin la, mi ken kama anpa pakala lon seli. ni la, monsi mi en len pona laso mi li ken kama pakala seli."""
,"The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.",,"lupa kon li suli, li tan tenpo pini mute. tenpo open ona la, jan li seli e kasi suli mute lon poki seli."
,"The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain.",,"lupa kon li tawa selo sewi tomo la, pini ona li sama palisa kiwen. suno li kama lon insa lupa tan sewi ni, li poka e palisa awen pi weka telo."
," Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up.",,"soweli Nija li kama pilin ike wawa tan kama pi sona ala! ona li awen tawa sewi, tawa sewi, tawa sewi."
," Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little sweep himself.",,"tenpo ni la, noka ona li tawa lon suli pi ko pimeja. ona li sama ilo pi weka ko."
,"It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another.",,"ale li pimeja la, ale li nasa. pilin la, lupa li kama nasin mute, li tawa lupa mute."
,"There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.",,"kon walo li kama lili, taso sona nasin li kama weka tan soweli Nija."
,"He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some mutton bones lying about—",,"soweli li kama sewi, li kama sewi; taso lona li lon ala ale sewi la, kiwen wan li weka tan sinpin. lupa kiwen la, kiwen moku pi sijelo soweli li lon—"
,"This seems funny, said Tom Kitten. ""Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell? It is something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,"" said Tom Kitten.",,"soweli Nija li toki: ""ni li nasa. jan seme li moku e kiwen sijelo lon sewi ni? a, mi wile ala lon ni! kin la, kon li nasa tan seme? kon li sama soweli pi lili mute tawa mi; taso kon li wawa mute la, ni li tan ala soweli pi lili mute. mi kama wile pana wawa e kon tan nena mi."""
," He squeezed through the hole in the wall and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.",,"ona li tawa insa pi lupa kiwen la, pali ni li wile e wawa. ona li tawa nasin pi lili mute la, ni li pona ala tawa pilin, li pimeja mute."
," He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.",,"sona li tawa lon nasin ni kepeken tawa noka lili; sina lukin e sitelen lon open pi toki ni la, soweli li lon insa pi noka sinpin, li lon sitelen lili *."
,"All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.",,"tawa sin la, soweli li kama anpa wawa lon pimeja, li kama lawa anpa lon lupa, li kama lon mute pi len jaki."
,"When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him—he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.",,"soweli Nija li kama sewi lili sin la, ona li lukin lon poka ale—ona li lon tomo lon ale tenpo ona, taso ona li sona ala e poka ni. "
,"It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster.",,"kon pi tomo lili ni li ike lili, li awen lon insa tomo. tomo lili li jo e supa lili e palisa awen sewi e linja len tan pipi e sinpin pi palisa mute e walo pi awen kiwen."
,"Opposite to him—as far away as he could sit—was an enormous rat.",,"lon poka ante pi tomo lili—lon weka mute pi ken soweli ale—la soweli pi lili ala li lon."
,"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts? said the rat, chattering his teeth.",,"soweli ni li toki: ""tan seme la sina kama lon supa lape mi? sina pana e ko pimeja lon supa mi a."" kiwen uta ona li tawa la, kalama li kama."
," ""Please, sir, the chimney wants sweeping,"" said poor Tom Kitten.",,"soweli Nija li toki: ""soweli o, lupa pi kon seli la, jaki o weka tan ona."""
," ""Anna Maria! Anna Maria!"" squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.",,"soweli pi lili ala li mu: ""soweli Utawa o! soweli Utawa o!"" kalama noka li kama la, soweli meli pi lili ala li kama lukin e mije ona tan poka pi palisa awen wan."
,"All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening—",,"pini lukin la, meli li tawa soweli Nija kepeken tenpo lili. soweli Nija li sona ala e kama ale la"
,"His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.",,"len ona li kama weka tan luka pi soweli ante. soweli ante li sike e ona, li lili e ona, li awen e ona kepeken linja kepeken wan linja mute pi awen wawa."
,"Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and took snuff. When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.",,"soweli Utawa li wan e linja. soweli ante li lukin e pali ona, li pana e namako nasa tawa nena ona."
,"Anna Maria, said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers),—""Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner.""",,"soweli pi namako nasa li soweli Utaki, li toki: ""soweli Utawa, o pali e pan soweli pi sike palisa tawa moku mi."""
,"It requires dough and a pat of butter and a rolling pin, said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.",,"soweli Utawa li lukin e soweli Nija tan poka anpa, li toki: ""a, ni li wile e ko pan, e ko moku jelo, e ilo palisa pi pali sike."""
," ""No,"" said Samuel Whiskers, ""make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs.""",,"soweli Utaki li toki: ""ala a. o pali pona e pan, kepeken namako pan."""
," ""Nonsense! Butter and dough,"" replied Anna Maria.",,"soweli Utawa kin li toki: ""ante ike a! ko pan en ko jelo li pona."""
,"The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away. Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet anybody. He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel. He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were too busy lighting the candle to look into the chest. They did not see him. Anna Maria went down by way of skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough. She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws. She did not observe Moppet. While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help. But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him. Except a spider who came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance. It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him. Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted. Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough. Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?"" inquired Samuel Whiskers.",,"soweli ni tu li toki lon tenpo awen lili, li tawa weka. soweli Utaki li tawa lupa lon noka sinpin, li tawa nasin pi tawa anpa, li kama jo weka e ko moku jelo. ona li pilin ike ala tan lukin ken, taso jan ala li lukin e ona. ona li tawa sin, li kama jo weka e ilo pi pali sike. ona li tawa e ilo lon sinpin ona kepeken luka ona. jan pi pali telo li tawa e poki sike telo suli la, ni li sama tawa lukin. ona li ken kute e toki pi soweli Lenja e toki pi soweli Mamako, taso soweli ni tu li lukin e poki kepeken suno pi palisa seli la, ijo ala li suli tawa ona tu. ona tu li kama ala lukin e soweli Utaki tan ni. tenpo sama la, soweli Utawa li tawa anpa tomo lon poka pi noka sinpin, li tawa lon poka pi selo len lupa lon lupa lukin, li wile jo e ko pan. ona li kepeken poki lili, li wile ala awen jo e poki lon tenpo ale. ona li poki e ko kepeken luka. ona li kama ala lukin e soweli Puwan. soweli Nija li wan taso lon insa anpa pi selo sewi tomo la, ona li lukin kama weka, li lukin mu tawa jan ante. taso ike la, ko pimeja en linja len pipi li lon uta ona. ike kin la, linja li lon ale pi sijelo ona, li li ken e kute ala tan jan ante. taso pipi wan li ken kute e ona, li tan pakala lupa lili lon sewi tomo. pipi li awen weka la, ona li lukin e wan linja pali pi awen wawa lon sona. sona ona pi wan linja li wawa li suli tan ni: ona li alasa linja e pipi lili waso laso. ona li pana ala e pona pali tawa soweli Nija. soweli Nija li tawa, li tawa, li tawa mute la, wawa ona li kama lape. tenpo ni la, soweli tu pi lili ala li kama sin, li open e pali, li wile pan sike e soweli Nija. soweli Utaki li toki: ""a, taso soweli Utawa o, linja awen li ike tawa moku mi, anu seme?"""
," Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry. She laid hold of his ears.",,"soweli Utawa li toki: ""ni li suli ala. taso wile mi la, soweli ni o pini e tawa pi lawa ona. ni li nasa e ko."" ona li kama jo awen e kute ona."
,"Tom Kitten bit and spit, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling pin went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.",,"soweli Nija li utala uta, li pana utala e telo tan uta, li mu utala, li tawa utala; ilo palisa pi pali sike li tawa sike, li tawa sike, li tawa sike, li tawa sike-sike. soweli wan li lon pini ilo wan la, soweli ante li lon pini ilo ante."
,"His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.",,"""palisa monsi ona li kama tawa lukin tan pan! soweli Utawa o, sina kama ala e ko pan pi mute pona."""
,"I fetched as much as I could carry, replied Anna Maria.",,"soweli Utawa li toki: ""mi kama e ko lon ale jo pi ken mi a."""
,"I do not think—said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten—""I do not think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.""",,"soweli Utaki li open e toki: ""pilin mi la""—ona li pini e toki lon awen lili, li lukin e soweli Nija—""pilin mi la, ona li kama ala pan pona. kon ona li sama ko pimeja."""
,"Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above—the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!",,"soweli Utawa li wile open e utala toki la, kalama ante pi sin suli li kama tan sewi—ilo pali pi pana pakala li kalama; mu kin pi soweli pona en kalama kin pi luka soweli pali li lon!"
," The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.",,"soweli tu pi lili ala li anpa e ilo, li kute pona."
,"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property,—and other people's,—and depart at once. I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.",,"""a, jan ante li kama lukin e mi, soweli Utawa o; mi o kama jo e ijo ale mi—e ijo pi jan ante kin. ni la, mi o tawa. ike la, mi ken ala tawa e pan ni. pan li awen."
," ""But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary.""",,"pilin kin pi mi wan la, wan linja li kama ike e insa mi tan moku. sina toki ante la, ni li ante ala e pilin mi."""
,"Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane, said Anna Maria. ""I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney.""",,"soweli Utawa li toki: ""o kama lon tenpo ni. mi tu li wile poki e kiwen moku pi sijelo soweli. ni li mute lon lupa pi kon seli tan pana mi."""
," So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up—there was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!",,"ni la, soweli Pela li kama weka e selo tan supa ma la—ilo taso pi pali sike en soweli Nija taso pi selo pan jaki li lon!"
," But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.",,"taso kon li sama soweli pi lili ala tawa nena. tenpo awen mute la, soweli Pela li awen alasa, li awen pilin e kon, li tawa e palisa monsi ona, li tawa, li tawa sike lon poka lupa ale."
,"Then he nailed the plank down again, and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs.",,"pini la, ona li pona sin e selo, li poki e ilo, li kama lon anpa tomo."

,"They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.",,"soweli suli li telo e soweli Nija lon telo seli pona la, ko jelo li kama weka tan selo ona."
,"John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops.",,"soweli Pela li pilin e kon pan; taso ona li pali e poki pi sike tu tawa jan Pota lon tenpo pini lili, li wile pali e poki waso awn tu tawa jan Pota la, ona li ken ala awen lon tenpo moku."

," After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.",,

,"And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers—children and grand-children and great great grand-children.",,
,"There is no end to them!",,
,"Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.",,
,"They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment. They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very comfortably.",,
