"Text start","The Tale of mrs. Tittlemouse",,"soweli Melili pi lili mute"
,"ONCE upon a time there was a wood-mouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse.",,"tenpo wan la soweli pi lili mute li lon, li lon ma pi kasi suli. kute sike tu li lon lawa ona. nimi ona li Melili."
,"She lived in a bank under a hedge.",,"tomo ona li lupa lon noka pi kasi kiwen anpa."
,"SUCH a funny house! There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to storerooms and nut-cellars and seed-cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge.",,"tomo li musi suwi a! ko ma la, lupa li tawa insa, li tawa, li tawa, li ken tawa tomo pi awen kili, li ken tawa tomo pi awen pan lon noka kasi kiwen."
,"THERE was a kitchen, a parlor, a pantry, and a larder.",,"tomo pi pali moku en tomo moku en tomo mute pi awen moku li lon kin."
,"Also, there was Mrs. Tittlemouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!",,"kin la, tomo lape pi soweli Melili lo lon. supa lape ona li poki lili a!"
,"MRS. TITTLEMOUSE was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.",,"soweli Melili li soweli pona nasin a, li wile weka e jakin tan tomo lon tenpo ale, li weka e ko ma e ko jaki lon ma supa lon tenpo ale."
,"Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.",,"tenpo la, pipi li ken kama lon nasin pi tomo ona."
,"Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet! said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dustpan.",,"ona li kalama kepeken ilo pi weka jaki, li toki wawa: ""o weka, o weka, noka jaki o!"""
,"AND one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.",,"tenpo suno wan la, pipi pi mute tenpo li kama, li jo e selo loje e sike pimeja lon loje."
,"Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your children!",,"""pipi mama Seloje o, ken la tomo sina li kama pakala a! o tawa wawa, o awen e pipi lili sina!"""
,"ANOTHER day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.",,"tenpo suno wan ante la, pipi suli pi noka luka tu wan li kama, li wile ala e telo kama lon ona tan sewi."
,"Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?",,"""a, toki a, ni li tomo ala pi meli Epipiku anu seme?"""
,"Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!",,"""o weka, pipi suli ike o! sina pana e linja len ko lon tomo mi a!"""
,"SHE bundled the spider out at a window.",,"soweli li wawa e tawa weka pipi, li kama weka e ona tan lupa lon sinpin."
,"He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.",,"pipi li kepeken linja ona, li kama anpa weka lon linja."
,"MRS. TITTLEMOUSE went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherry-stones and thistle-down seed for dinner.",,"soweli Melili li tawa sin, li wile tawa tomo weka pi awen moku, li wile e kiwen kili e pan pi kasi len walo tawa moku."
,"All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.",,"ona li lon nasin la, nena ona li pilin e kon. ona li lukin e ma anpa."
,"I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet.",,"""mi ken pilin e suwi sama ko tan pipi jelo pimeja; ni li tan kasi suwi kule lon poka tomo anu seme? pilin la, mi ken kute e noka lili jaki kin."
,"SUDDENLY round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble—""Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!"" said the bumble bee.",,"ni a la ona li kama lukin e pipi jelo pimeja Monsike—lipu pipi waso li mu pipi e mu e mu e mu!"
,"Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely. She wished that she had a broom.",,"soweli Melili li lukin e ona lon wile ike. ilo pi jaki weka li pona tawa wile ona lon tenpo ni."
,"Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. But what are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, and say, Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz? Mrs. Tittlemouse began to get cross.",,"""toki, pipi Monsike o; sina wile esun e ko suwi la, ni li pona tawa mi. taso sina lon ni pi tomo mi tan seme? sina kama kepeken lupa lukin lon tenpo ale tan seme? sina mu e mu pipi sina tan seme a?"" soweli li kama pilin utala."
,"ZIZZ, Wizz, Wizzz! replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak. She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.",,"pipi Monsike li kama pilin pi wile weka li mu ike wawa tan ni: mu, mu mu! ona li weka tawa tomo wan pi awen moku. tomo ni li tawa kili kiwen."
,"Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.",,"soweli Melili li moku e kili ale tan tomo ni lon tenpo pini; ni la, ala o lon tomo ni."
,"But it was full of untidy dry moss.",,"taso ko kasi laso mute pi telo ala li lon, li jaki."
,"MRS. TITTLEMOUSE began to pull out the moss. Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.",,"soweli Melili li kama weka e ko kasi. pipi tu wan en pipi wan kin li kama len ala tan ni, li mu pipi lon wawa."
,"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion! said Mrs. Tittlemouse. ""I will have them turned out—"" ""Buzz! Buzz! Buzzz!""—""I wonder who would help me?"" ""Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!""",,"soweli Melili li toki: ""nasin mi la, mi pana ala e tomo tawa jan ante; sina kama tan wile mi ala a, li pakala e nasin pona! mi kama weka e sina ale a—"" ""mu! mu! mu!""—""a jan seme li ken pana e pali weka ni tawa mi?"" ""mu, mu, mu!"""
,"—""I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet.""",,"—""a, mi wile ala e akesi Wekala; ona li weka ala e jaki tan noka ona lon tenpo ale."""
,"MRS. TITTLEMOUSE decided to leave the bees till after dinner.",,"pini la, soweli Melili li wile e ken pi weka pipi lon pini pi tenpo moku."
,"When she got back to the parlor, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself!",,"ona li kama lon tomo moku la, ona li kute e kalama uta wawa; a, ni a li akesi Wekala a!"
,"He was sitting all over a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.",,"akesi li lape e monsi ona lon supa lili pi tawa monsi sinpin. ona li musi e luka ona. uta ona li pona sewi tan pilin pona. noka ona li lon sinpin pi poki seli."
,"He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.",,"tomo ona li lupa telo lon anpa pi kasi kiwen."
,"HOW do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!",,"""toki, akesi Wekala o. ike a, telo mute li lon sina!"""
,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I'll sit awhile and dry myself, said Mr. Jackson.",,"akesi Wekala li toki: ""a, soweli Melili o, sina pona, sina pona, sina pona! mi awen lon ni la telo li kama weka tan mi a."""
,"He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.",,"ona li awen, li sinpin e pilin pona. telo li kama anpa lili tan len ona. soweli Melili li kepeken len, li weka e telo."
,"HE sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?",,"ona li awen lon tenpo mute a la ni li wile e toki tan soweli: ""sina wile e moku anu seme?"""
,"First she offered him cherry-stones. ""Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!"" said Mr. Jackson.",,"open la, soweli li pana e kiwen kili tawa akesi. akesi Wekala li toki: ""a, wile sina li pona, soweli Melili o! taso mi jo ala e kiwen uta la, mi ken ala moku e ni a."""
,"He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.",,"ona li open e uta, li open mute suli wawa namako e uta; lukin la, kiwen ala a li lon uta ona."
,"THEN she offered him thistle-down seed—""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff!"" said Mr. Jackson. He blew the thistle-down all over the room.",,"ni la, soweli li pana e pan pi kasi len walo tawa akesi. akesi li toki: ""musi, musi, musi! ko, ko, kon!"" ona li pana e kon tan uta, li tawa e len pan lon ale pi tomo ni."
,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what I really—really should like—would be a little dish of honey!",,"""a, wile sina li pona mute a, soweli Melili o! tenpo ni la, mi wile—a, mi wile mute e ko suwi tan pipi jelo pimeja!"""
,"IAM afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson! said Mrs. Tittlemouse.",,"soweli li toki: ""a, ike la, mi jo ala e ni, akesi Wekala o!"""
,"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse! said the smiling Mr. Jackson, ""I can smell it; that is why I came to call.""",,"pilin pona li lon sinpin akesi. ""musi, musi, musi, soweli Melili o! mi ken pilin e suwi lon kon kepeken nena mi. mi toki e wile ni tan ni."""
,"Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards.",,"akesi Wekala li kama sewi tan supa, li tawa supa poki, li open e poki supa, li lukin e insa poki."
,"Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dish-cloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor.",,"soweli Melili li lon monsi ona. jaki telo li kama tan noka akesi la, soweli li weka e jaki ni tan ma supa."
,"WHEN he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.",,"ona li kama sona e ala pi ko suwi lon poki ale la, ona li open e tawa, li tawa nasin tomo."
,"Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!",,"""a, ken la sina kama awen a, akesi Wekala o!"""
,"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!",,"""musi, musi, musi, soweli Melili o!"""
,"FIRST he squeezed into the pantry.",,"open la, ona li tawa kepeken pali mute, li kama tawa tomo wan pi awen moku."
,"Tiddly, widdly, widdly? no honey? no honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?",,"""musi, musi, musi? a, ko suwi ala anu seme, soweli o?"""
,"There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate-rack. Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.",,"pipi tu wan taso li lon supa pi ilo moku. pipi tu li ken kama weka, taso akesi li ken jo e pipi lili."
,"THEN he squeezed into the larder. Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.",,"ni la, ona li tawa sin. selo ona li selo e sinpin poka. ona li kama tawa tomo ante pi awen moku. pipi waso pi kule mute li moku lili e suwi kiwen. taso kama ni la, ona li tawa kon lon lupa poka."
,"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!",,"""musi, musi, musi, soweli Melili o; jan mute a li kama tawa tomo sina!"""
,"And without any invitation! said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.",,"soweli Melili li toki: ""kin la, mi pana ala e ken ni tawa ona!"""
,"THEY went along the sandy passage—""Tiddly, widdly—"" ""Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!""",,"ona tu li awen tawa lon nasin ko—""musi, musi—"" ""mu! mu! mu!"""
,"He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.",,"akesi li kama lukin e pipi Monsike, li jo e ona, li weka e ona tan jo."
,"I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles, said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat-sleeve.",,"akesi li toki: ""pipi ni li ike tawa mi. linja sijelo ale ona li palisa lili, li ike."" akesi li luka e telo tan uta ona."
,"Get out, you nasty old toad! shrieked Babbitty Bumble.",,"pipi Monsike li kalama: ""o weka a, akesi ike o!"""
,"I shall go distracted! scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.",,"soweli Melili li toki pilin: ""mi o tawa ante!"""
,"SHE shut herself up in the nut-cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest. He seemed to have no objection to stings.",,"ona li tawa tomo awen pi kili kiwen, li pini awen e lupa. akesi Wekala li kama weka e supa pipi. pipi Monsike li utala e ona kepeken palisa utala monsi ona, taso ni li pini ala e pali ona."
,"When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out—everybody had gone away.",,"soweli Melili li kama sin la, jan ale li weka."
,"But the untidiness was something dreadful—""Never did I see such a mess—smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown—and marks of big and little dirty feet—all over my nice clean house!""",,"taso jaki mute li lon, li ike a—""tenpo ala la, jaki li sama ni, li suli ni—ko suwi pipi li lon mute; ko kasi laso li lon; len pan kin li lon—sama la, jaki pi noka suli en jaki pi noka lili li lon—li lon ale pi tomo pona mi pi jaki ala a!"""
,"SHE gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax.",,"ona li wan e ko kasi ale, e ko pipi."
,"Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.",,"ona li tawa ma tan tomo ona, li kama jo e palisa kasi lon poka tomo."
,"I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!",,"""mi wile e ni: lupa li kama lili ike tawa akesi a!"""
,"SHE fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom. But she was too tired to do any more. First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.",,
,"Will it ever be tidy again? said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse.",,"soweli pi pilin ike li toki: ""jaki li kama weka lon tenpo a anu seme a?"""
,"NEXT morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fortnight.",,"open pi tenpo suno kama la, ona li pini e lape lon tenpo lili. ona li open e pali pi weka jaki, li pali lon tenpo suno mute a."
,"She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with beeswax, and polished her little tin spoons.",,"ona li kepeken ilo lon ale tomo, li kepeken len pi weka jaki, li weka e jaki e ko; ona li pona e selo supa kepeken ko pipi, li pona telo e ilo moku."
,"WHEN it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.",,"ale li pona li jaki ala la, ona li wile musi kulupu, li kama e soweli luka pi lili mute, li kama ala e akesi Wekala."
,"He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door.",,"akesi li pilin e musi lon kon kepeken nena, li kama tawa lupa tomo, taso ona li ken ala tawa insa tan lili lupa."
,"SO they handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended.",,"ni la, soweli li pana e telo suwi pipi lon poki pi selo kili kiwen lon lupa lukin. ni la, akesi li pilin ike ala."
,"He sat outside in the sun, and said—""Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!""",,"ona li awen lon suno, li toki: ""musi, musi, musi! pona o awen lon sina, soweli Melili o!"""
