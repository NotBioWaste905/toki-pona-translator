"Text start","The Tale of ⁠Tom Kitten",,"soweli Nija"
,"ONCE upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.",,"tenpo wan la, soweli sin tu wan li lon. ona li soweli alasa, li soweli pi kalama noka ala, li soweli tomo suwi. ona tu wan li soweli Suwile, li soweli Nija, li soweli Puwan."
,"They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.",,"linja sijelo ona li sama len awen. ona li tawa mute lon poka pi lupa tomo, li musi mute lon ma jaki ko."
,"BUT one day their mother–Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit–expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.",,"taso tenpo suno wan la soweli mama ona Mamako li wile e soweli pona lon tomo, li wile moku e telo seli pona lon poka pi soweli pona; ni la ona li kama jo e soweli lili, li tawa e ona lon insa tomo, li wile telo e sijelo ona, li wile len pona e ona tan kama pi soweli pona."
,"FIRST she scrubbed their faces, (this one is Moppet).",,"nanpa wan la, mama li telo pona e sinpin pi soweli lili. (soweli Puwan li lon sitelen ni.)"
,"THEN she brushed their fur, (this one is Mittens).",,"nanpa tu la, mama li nasin pona e linja sijelo pi soweli lili. (soweli Suwile li lon sitelen ni.)"
,"THEN she combed their tails and whiskers, (this is Tom Kitten).",,"nanpa tu wan la, mama li nasin pona e linja suli sinpin pi soweli lili. (soweli Nija li lon sitelen ni.)"
,"Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.",,"soweli Nija li ike wile, li luka utala."
,"MRS. TABITHA dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.",,"soweli Mamako li insa e soweli Puwan e soweli Suwile lon len suwi pi suli sijelo, li pana e len namako kin lon len ni. ona li wile len e soweli Nija la, ona li kama jo e len mute pi pona mute tan poki len, taso len ni li ike pilin lon sijelo."
,"TOM KITTEN was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. His mother sewed them on again.",,"soweli Nija li suli sike mute, li kama suli; kiwen li awen e len lon sijelo la, kiwen awen mute li kama weka wawa pakala tan len. mama li kepeken linja, li awen sin e kiwen."
,"WHEN the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.",,"soweli lili tu wan li kama len ale la, ona li wile pali e pan pona. ni la, soweli lili o weka. mama li tawa e soweli lili lon ma kasi lili lon poka tomo. nasin sona la, ni li ike."
,"Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pig-stye and the Puddle-Ducks.",,"""soweli lili, o awen pona e len sina! jaki o lon ala len! o tawa kepeken noka monsi taso. o tawa ala ko pimeja jaki. o tawa ala waso Meliweli. o tawa ala soweli pi loke walo. o tawa ala waso telo."
,"MOPPET and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.",,"soweli Puwan en soweli Suwile li tawa nasa lon nasin pi ma kasi lili. tenpo ni la, ona li noka e len ona, li kama anpa wawa lon sinpin."
,"When they stood up there were several green smears!",,"ona li kama sewi sin la, laso mute li lon len ona a!"
,"LET us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall, said Moppet.",,"soweli Puwan li toki: ""mi ale o tawa sewi pi sinpin kiwen lon selo pi ma ni a."""
,"They turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.",,"ona li monsi e sinpin len, li sinpin e monsi len. ona li tawa sewi kepeken tawa wawa wan; len namako pi soweli Puwan li kama anpa, li awen lon ma pi nasin suli."
,"TOM KITTEN was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left.",,"soweli Nija li tawa kepeken noka, li jo e len ike la, ona li ken ala a tawa sewi sama. ona li tawa poka sinpin, li tawa sewi lili lon kiwen, li kama sewi pona. ona li selo e kasi mute la, kiwen awen li kama weka, li kama weka."
,"HE was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.",,"ona li kama lon sewi pona la, len ona li open mute."
,"Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.",,"soweli Puwan en soweli Suwile li wile pona e len pi soweli Nija; len lawa ona li kama weka; kiwen mute ala li awen lon len, taso kiwen ni ki li kama weka."
,"WHILE they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three Puddle-Ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step—pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!",,"ike ni li lon ona la, kalama lili noka Noka Noka Noka li kama. ni li tan kama pi soweli telo walo tu wan lon ma nasin. waso wan li lon monsi pi waso ante. ona li tawa lon ma kepeken noka waso ona la, ni li nasa musi lili tawa lukin, li kama e kalama noka Noka Noka Noka Noka a!"
,"THEY stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised.",,"ona li pini e tawa, li lukin tawa sewi, li lukin e soweli tu wan. lukin waso li lili mute. pilin ona li wawa tan sin pi kama ni."
,"THEN the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.",,"tenpo ni la, waso Jalanpa en waso Jonken li kama jo e len lawa, e len namako, li len e sijelo ona kepeken ni."
,"MITTENS laughed so that she fell off the wall. Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.",,"ni li musi mute e pilin pi soweli Suwile la, ona li mu mute wawa e pilin, li kama anpa tan mu a. soweli Puwan en soweli Nija li wile tawa ona, li tawa anpa la, len ante kin li kama weka, li kama anpa."
,"Come! Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck, said Moppet–""Come and help us to dress him! Come and button up Tom!""",,"soweli Puwan li toki: ""waso Lenpan o kama! o pali pona sin: mi wile len e soweli. soweli Nija, o awen pona e len sina!"""
,"MR. DRAKE PUDDLE-DUCK advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles.",,"waso Lenpan li tawa poka kepeken wawa ala, li kama jo e len ale."
,"BUT he put them on himself! They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.",,"taso ona li len e sijelo ona a! suli len li ike tawa soweli Nija la, suli len li ike mute tawa waso a."
,"It's a very fine morning! said Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck.",,"waso Lenpan li toki: ""ni li tenpo pona a!"""
,"AND he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-Duck set off up the road, keeping step–pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!",,"ni la, ona en waso Jonken en waso Jalanpa li tawa, li kepeken noka, li kalama noka Noka Noka Noka Noka!"
,"THEN Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.",,
,"SHE pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.",,
,"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted, said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.",,
,"SHE sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true.",,
,"QUITE the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least.",,
,"Somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.",,
,"AND I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!",,
,"AS for the Puddle-Ducks–they went into a pond.",,
,"The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.",,
,"AND Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah have been looking for them ever since. ",,
