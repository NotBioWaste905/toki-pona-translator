,"ONCE upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes. She had eight of a family; four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot;",,"tenpo wan la, soweli pi loje walo li lon. ona li soweli Seloje, li lon tenpo mute. ona li mama e soweli luka tu wan. soweli lili meli li soweli Wawalo, li soweli Teloje, li soweli Mokule, li soweli Tomonsi;"
," and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-Chin and Stumpy. Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.",,"soweli lili mije li soweli Mokuntu, li soweli Waloje, li soweli Siken, li soweli Monsin. tenpo pini la, pakala li kama lon palisa lili monsi pi soweli Monsin."
,"The eight little pigs had very fine appetites—""Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they do eat!"" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride. Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.",,"wile moku pi soweli lili ale li suli pona—soweli Seloje li lukin e kulupu lon pilin pona, li toki: ""pona, pona, pona! ona li moku, li moku kin!"" sin wawa la, mu ike li lon; soweli Mokuntu li kama awen lon palisa sike sewi lon poki pi pana moku, li ken ala weka."
,"Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.",,"soweli Seloje en mi li jo wawa e noki monsi ona, li tawa weka e ona."
," Chin-chin was already in disgrace; it was washing day, and he had eaten a piece of soap. And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found another dirty little pig!—""Tchut, tut, tut! whichever is this?"" grunted Aunt Pettitoes.",,"tenpo sama la, soweli Siken li ike; ni li tenpo telo pi weka jaki la, ona li moku e ko pi weka jaki. kin la, mi mute li kama lukin e soweli jaki sama lon poki len lon len pi jaki ala!—soweli Seloje li mu: ""ike, ike, ike! sina soweli seme?"""
,"Now all the pig family are pink, or pink with black spots, but this pig child was smutty black all over; when it had been popped into a tub, it proved to be Yock-yock.",,"soweli ale lon kulupu ni li loje walo anu pimeja lili lon loje walo mute, taso soweli lili ni li pimeja ale tan jaki a; soweli li kama lon telo la, sona li kama: ni li soweli Mokule."
," I went into the garden; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots. I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears. Cross-patch tried to bite me.",,"mi tawa ma kili; ma ni la, mi kama lukin e soweli Wawalo e soweli Teloje. ona tu li moku e kili pi loje jelo. mi wan li utala e ona, li tawa e kute ona e ona. soweli Wawalo li lukin utala uta e mi."
," ""Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes! you are a worthy person, but your family is not well brought up. Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and Pigling Bland.""",,"""soweli Seloje o, soweli Seloje o! sina jan pona, taso kulupu sina li lon nasin ike. soweli ni pi sama ale li pali e ike. soweli Tomonsi taso en soweli Waloje taso li pali ala e ike."""
,"Yus, yus! sighed Aunt Pettitoes. ""And they drink bucketfuls of milk; I shall have to get another cow! Good little Spot shall stay at home to do the housework; but the others must go. Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether."" ""Yus, yus, yus,"" said Aunt Pettitoes, ""there will be more to eat without them.""",,"soweli Seloje li toki kepeken pilin: ""lon, lon!"" mi toki: ""sama la, ona li moku e telo walo mute pi soweli mani; mi o kama e soweli mani ante! soweli lili pona Tomonsi li ken awen lon tomo, li ken pali e pali tomo; taso soweli ante o tawa weka. soweli lili mije tu tu en soweli lili meli tu tu li mute ike lon ni."" soweli Seloje li toki sin: ""lon, lon, lon. ona li weka la, mute moku li ken pona mute."""
," So Chin-chin and Suck-Suck went away in a wheel-barrow, and Stumpy, Yock-yock and Cross-patch rode away in a cart.",,"ni la, soweli Siken en soweli Teloje li tawa weka lon insa pi poki tawa kili; soweli Monsin en soweli Mokule en soweli Wawalo li tawa lon tomo lili tawa."
,"And the other two little boy pigs, Pigling Bland and Alexander went to market. We brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their little faces, and wished them good-bye in the yard.",,"soweli mije ante tu li soweli Waloje, li soweli Mokuntu, li tawa ma esun. mi en soweli Seloje li nasin e len ona, li sike e palisa lili monsi ona, li telo e sinpin lili ona. mi tu li toki e wile pi tawa pona tawa ona."
,"Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland’s nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander’s nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot. Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows—",,"soweli Seloje li weka e telo tan lukin ona kepeken len poki suli. ona li weka e jaki lili tan nena pi soweli Waloje, li pana e telo mute tan lukin; ona li weka e jaki lili tan nena pi soweli Mokuntu kin, li pama e telo mute kin tan lukin. ni la, ona li pana e len poki tawa soweli Tomonsi. soweli Seloje li pana e kon suli wan tan pilin, li mu, li toki tawa soweli lili—"
,"Now Pigling Bland; son Pigling Bland, you must go to market. Take your brother Alexander by the hand. Mind your Sunday clothes, and remember to blow your nose— (Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again)—""beware of traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs; always walk upon your hind legs."" Pigling Bland, who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother; a tear trickled down his cheek.",,"""a, soweli Waloje o, sina o tawa esun. o luka e luka pi soweli sama Mokuntu, o awen lon poka ona. o jaki ala e len pona. sona awen la, o weka e jaki tan nena.""—(sin la, soweli Seloje li kepeken len poki)—""o lukin e ilo alasa jo, e waso mani mije, e ko moku soweli, e soke waso. o awen kepeken noka monsi sina lon tawa."" soweli Waloje li soweli pi nasin pona la, ona li lukin wawa tawa mama ona; telo lili wan li kama tan lukin ona, li tawa anpa sinpin."
,"Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other—""Now, son Alexander, take the hand""—""Wee, wee, wee!"" giggled Alexander—""take the hand of your brother Pigling Bland, you must go to market. Mind—"" ""Wee, wee, wee!"" interrupted Alexander again. ""You put me out,"" said Aunt Pettitoes—",,"soweli Seloje li lukin tawa soweli lili ante—""a, soweli lili mi Mokuntu o, sina o luka e luka""—soweli Mokuntu li pana e pilin musi ona: ""mu, mu, mu!""—""o luka e luka pi soweli sama sina. sina tu o tawa esun. o lukin—"" soweli lili li insa sin e mu lon toki: ""mu, mu, mu!"" soweli mama li toki: ""sina ike e pilin mi.—"
," ""Observe sign-posts and milestones; do not gobble herring bones—"" ""And remember,"" said I impressively, ""if you once cross the county boundary you cannot come back.",,"""o lukin e sitelen nasin. o lukin e kiwen nasin. o moku ala e kiwen  tan sijelo kala."" mi toki wawa: ""o sona e ni kin: sina tawa ma ante la, sina ken ala kama sin lon ma ni."
," Alexander, you are not attending. Here are two licences permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire. Attend Alexander. I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman."" Pigling Bland listened gravely; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.",,"soweli Mokuntu o, sina kute ala. mi pana e lipu lawa nasin tawa sina tu. lipu ni tu la, soweli tu li ken tawa esun lon ma tomo. soweli Waloje o, sina o awen e soweli Mokuntu. jan pi awen lawa la lipu ni li wile e pali mute tan mi."" soweli Waloje li kute pona wawa; soweli Mokuntu li kute nasa."
,"I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets; Aunt Petittoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation",,"mi awen e lipu lon poka insa pi len ona; tawa soweli tu la, soweli Seloje li pana sama e poki moku, e suwi "
," peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper. Then they started.",,"lili luka tu wan pi toki suwi lon selo lipu pi toki suwi. ni la, soweli tu li open e tawa."
,"Pigling Bland and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile;",,"soweli Waloje en soweli Mokuntu li awen tawa pona lon poka lon nasin suli wan;"
," at least Pigling Bland did. Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side. He danced about and pinched his brother, singing—",,"a, soweli Waloje taso li tawa pona. soweli Mokuntu li tawa lon poka nasin wan, li tawa lon poki nasin ante, li sike e ni la, nasin li kama suli sama nasin tu. ona li tawa musi, li luka musi e soweli sama ona, li kalama e musi—"
,"This pig went to market, this pig stayed at home, This pig had a bit of meat—",,"""soweli wan li tawa esun. soweli ante li awen lon tomo, soweli pi ante kin li jo e ko moku soweli—"
,"let's see what they have given us for dinner, Pigling!""",,"a, soweli Waloje o, mi o lukin e moku tan mama mi!"""
,"Pigling Bland and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles. Alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time; he had already eaten all his own peppermints—""Give me one of yours, please, Pigling?"" ""But I wish to preserve them for emergencies,"" said Pigling Bland doubtfully. Alexander went into squeals of laughter. Then he pricked Pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when Pigling slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take Pigling's pin, and the papers got mixed up. Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.",,"soweli Waloje en soweli Mokuntu li lape e monsi ona lon anpa, li open e poki moku. soweli Mokuntu li moku e moku ona lon tenpo lili; ona li moku e suwi namako ona ale lon tenpo pini—""soweli Waloje o, sina ken ala ken pana e suwi sina lili tawa mi?"" soweli Waloje li pilin pi sona ala: ""mi wile awen e ona tawa tenpo kama pi ken pakala"" soweli Mokuntu li mu mute e pilin musi. palisa lili ilo li awen e lipu lon len pi soweli Mokuntu la, ona li jo weka e palisa, li utala pakala lili e selo pi soweli Waloje kepeken palisa. soweli Waloje li utala loje e ona la, palisa li kama anpa. ni la, soweli Mokuntu li lukin jo e palisa ilo tan soweli Waloje. lipu tu pi ona tu li kama lon poka ike. soweli Waloje li toki ike e pali pi soweli Mokuntu."
,"But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing—",,"taso tenpo ni la, ona tu li kama weka e ike tan pilin. ona li tawa sin, li kalama—"
,"Tom, Tom the Piper’s son, stole a pig and away he ran! But all the tune that he could play, was 'Over the hills and far away!'""",,"""jan Lanpan li tawa. mama ona li kalama e musi mute. ona li jo ike e soweli lon nasin lawa ala, li tawa, li tawa! taso ona li sona kalama e musi wan taso"""
," ""What's that, young Sirs? Stole a pig? Where are your licences?"" said the policeman. They had nearly run against him round a corner. Pigling Bland pulled out his paper; Alexander, after fumbling, handed over something scrumply—",,"jan pi awen lawa li toki: ""ni li toki seme? seme li jo ike e soweli kepeken nasin lawa ala? lipu lawa sina li lon seme?"" soweli tu li kama tawa ona lon nasin pi kama sike. soweli Waloje li pana e lipu lawa ona. soweli Mokuntu li alasa e lipu, li kama pana e ijo lipu nasa—"
,"To 2½ oz. conversation sweeties at three farthings—""What's this? this ain't a licence?"" Alexander’s nose lengthened visibly, he had lost it. ""I had one, indeed I had, Mr. Policeman!""",,"""suwi lili ni pi toki suwi li wile e mani tu wan""—""ni li seme a? ni li lipu lawa ala!"" soweli Mokuntu li pilin anpa; ona li kama weka e lipu lawa ona. ""mo jo e ona lon tenpo pini, a, mi jo, jan awen o!"""
,"It's not likely they let you start without. I am passing the farm. You may walk with me. ""Can I come back too?"" inquired Pigling Bland. ""I see no reason, young Sir; your paper is all right."" Pigling Bland did not like going on alone, and it was beginning to rain. But it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight.",,"""a, pilin mi la, sina kama ala tawa kepeken ala lipu. mi tawa tomo ma. sina o tawa lon poka mi."" soweli Waloje li wile sona: ""mi kin li ken lon poka, anu seme?"" ""lipu sina li pona la, sina ken tawa nasin sina."" soweli Waloje li wile ala wan taso. sama la, telo li kama tan sewi. taso toki pi wile ante li ken ike lon jan awen la, soweli Waloje li pana e suwi wan tawa soweli sama ona, li lukin e tawa ona."
," To conclude the adventures of Alexander—the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time, followed by a damp subdued little pig. I disposed of Alexander in the neighborhood; he did fairly well when he had settled down.",,"sina wile sona e tenpo kama pi soweli Mokuntu la, o kute—jan awen li kama lon tomo mi lon tenpo pi telo moku seli. soweli lili li kama lon poka monsi ona. telo li lon ona tan sewi. tenpo la, mi pana e soweli Mokuntu tawa ma tomo ante; ona li kama awen lon tomo wan la, pona li kama awen lon ona."
,"Pigling Bland went on alone dejectedly; he came to cross roads and a sign-post—""To Market-town, 5 miles,"" ""Over the Hills, 4 miles,"" ""To Pettitoes Farm, 3 miles.""",,"soweli Waloje li awen tawa, li wan taso, li pilin pona ala; ona li tawa poka pi sitelen nasin lon wan pi nasin tu—""ma tomo esun li lon suli nasin luka"", ""ma nena li lon suli nasin tu tu""; ""tomo pi soweli Seloje li lon suli nasin tu wan"""
,"Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and to-morrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.",,"ni li sona sin ike tawa soweli Waloje. lape li ken ala lon ma esun tan tenpo; musi ike pi soweli Mokuntu li lili e tenpo a."
,"He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills, and then set off, walking obediently the other way, buttoning up his coat against the rain. He had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market to be stared at, pushed and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable—",,"pilin wile la, ona li lukin e nasin tawa ma nena, li tawa nasin pi ma esun. ona li pini awen e len ona tan telo sewi, li awen e len kepeken kiwen len. tenpo pini ala la, ona li wile tawa weka; ona li kama lon esun lon ala poka pi jan ante, li kama lon lukin pi jan mute, li kama pali lon jan pi pali kili lon tenpo kama la, kama ni ale li ike mute e pilin ona—"
,"I wish I could have a little garden and grow potatoes, said Pigling Bland.",,"soweli li toki: ""a, mi wile lawa e ma kili lili. mi wile kama e kili pan pi anpa ma lon ma pi wile mi."""
," He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper—Alexander's! Pigling squealed, then ran back frantically, hoping to overtake Alexander and the policeman.",,"ona li insa e luka ona wan lon poki lili lon len, li kama luka e lipu lawa. ona li insa e luka ante tawa poki lili lon poka len ante, li kama luka e lipu ante—ni li lipu pi soweli Mokuntu! soweli Waloje li mu pilin, li tawa monsi, li wile tawa soweli Mokuntu, li wile tawa jan Awen."
," He took a wrong turn—several wrong turns, and was quite lost.",,"ona li kama lon nasin ike—li kama lon nasin ike lon tenpo mute. ni la, ona li sona ala e nasin tawa tomo ona."
,"It grew dark, the wind whistled, the trees creaked and groaned.",,"pimeja li kama. kon tawa li mu. kasi suli kiwen li tawa la, ona li pana e kalama."
,"Pigling Bland became frightened and cried, ""Wee, wee, wee! I can’t find my way home!""",,"ni li anpa e pilin pi soweli Waloje. soweli li kalama: ""mu, mu, mu! mi sona ala e nasin tawa tomo mi!"""
,"After an hour's wandering he got out of the wood; the moon shone through the clouds, and Pigling Bland saw a country that was new to him.",,"ona li awen tawa lon tenpo la, ona li kama weka tan ma pi kasi suli; muni suli li suno lon insa pi len ko sewi la, soweli li lukin e ma ante pi sona ona sin."
,"The road crossed a moor; below was a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight and beyond—in misty distance—lay the hills.",,"nasin li tawa sewi pi ma ko telo. poka wan la, ma anpa suli li lon, li jo e telo nasin pi suno mun. poka ante la, nena suli li lon, li len tan ko kon lete."
," He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside—""I am afraid it is a hen house, but what can I do?"" said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.",,"soweli li kama lukin e tomo lili pi kiwen kasi, li tawa insa—ona li toki: ""ike la, ni li tomo waso, taso mi ken ala tawa tomo ante."" telo en lete en wile lape li lon ona."
,"Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs! clucked a hen on a perch.",,"waso mani wan li mu: ""ko moku soweli en sike waso! ko moku soweli en sike waso!"""
,"Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle! scolded the disturbed cockerel. ""To market, to market! jiggetty jig!"" clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him. Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak. In the meantime, he and the hens fell asleep.",,"waso mije li mu ike: ""ike, ike, ike! mu, mu, mu!"" waso walo li mu: ""tawa esun, tawa esun! tawa, tawa!"" ni li wawa nasa tawa soweli Waloje la, ona li wile tawa weka lon open pi tenpo suno kama. tenpo ni la, ona en waso poka li kama lape."
,"In less than an hour they were all awakened. The owner, Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning.",,"tenpo pi suli ala la, lape pi ona ale li kama pini. jan lawa waso li jan Lanpante li kama. ona li jo e ilo suno e poki. poki la, ona li wile insa awen e waso luka wan, li wile tawa e waso lon esun lon open pi tenpo suno."
,"He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock; then his eye fell upon Pigling Bland, squeezed up in a corner. He made a singular remark—""Hello, here's another!""—seized Pigling by the scruff of the neck, and dropped him into the hamper. Then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland.",,"ona li kama jo e waso walo lon poka pi waso mije; ni la, ona li kama lukin e soweli Waloje lon monsi tomo lon poka sinpin lon wile weka. ona li toki e ijo wan taso—""a, ona kin li lon!"" ona li jo e soweli Waloje lon monsi anpa lawa, li insa e soweli lon poki. ona li poki e waso utala mu jaki luka kin lon sewi soweli."
,"The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks. Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.",,"poki li jo e waso luka wan e soweli wan la, ona li wawa anpa. jan li tawa anpa nena, li kepeken tawa nasa wawa tan wawa anpa ni. soweli Waloje li pakala mute tan utala pi noka waso, li kama awen insa e lipu lawa ona e suwi namako lon len ona."
," At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was opened, and Pigling was lifted out. He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly, elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.",,"pini la, poki li kama lon ma anpa lon tomo moku. lupa sewi poki li kama open. jan li sewi weka e soweli. soweli Waloje li lukin tawa sewi, li kama lukin e jan, e jaki jan, e tenpo suli jan, e uta jan pi pilin musi suli."
,"This one's come of himself whatever, said Mr. Piperson, turning Pigling's pockets inside out. He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots.",,"jan Lanpante li toki: ""ona ni li kama lon ala poka pi jan ante."" ona li lukin e poki ale lon insa pi len soweli. ona li tawa e poki pi jo waso lon sinpin monsi, li pana e len lon poki tawa kalama waso ala. ona li seli e poki telo lon sewi seli, li open e len noka ona."
,"Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands. Mr. Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen. There was a smothered noise—""Shut up!"" said Mr. Piperson. Pigling Bland warmed his hands, and eyed him.",,"soweli Waloje li tawa e supa monsi, li kama lon selo supa sewi, li seli pona e luka ona lon poka seli. ona li pilin e lili ona. jan Lanpante li weka e len wan tan noka, li pana wawa e ni tawa sinpin wan lon poka tomo ante. kalama pi lili len li kama—jan Lanpante li toki: ""o kalama ala!"" soweli Waloje li awen seli e luka ona, li kama lukin tawa ona."
," Mr. Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first, there was again a curious noise—""Be quiet, will ye?"" said Mr. Piperson. Pigling Bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.",,"jan Lanpante li kama weka e len noka ante, li pana wawa e ni sama len nanpa wan. kalama nasa sin li kama—jan Lanpante li toki: ""o kalama ala a!"" soweli Waloje li lona ala supa ale, li lon selo supa taso."
," Mr. Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge, it seemed to Pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking; but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises.",,"jan Lanpante li kama e moku tan poki pi awen moku, li pali e pan ko. soweli Waloje la, ijo li lon poka tomo ante, li wile sona e moku; taso wile moku pi soweli Waloje li suli la, kalama nasa li suli ala tawa ona."
," Mr. Piperson poured out three platefuls: one for himself, one for Pigling, and a third—after glaring at Pigling—he put away with much scuffling, and locked up. Pigling Bland ate his supper discreetly.",,"jan Lanpante li pana e pan ko tawa kiwen jo supa tu wan: kiwen jo nanpa wan li tawa jan. kiwen jo nanpa tu li tawa soweli Waloje. kiwen jo nanpa tu wan la—jan li lukin e soweli Waloje la—jan li tawa e kiwen supa ni lon weka kepeken tenpo lili, li len awen e weka ni. soweli Waloje li moku e pan ko kepeken nasin pi wile ike ala."
,"After supper Mr. Piperson consulted an almanac, and felt Pigling’s ribs; it was too late in the season for curing bacon, and he grudged his meal. Besides, the hens had seen this pig.",,"moku li pini la, jan Lanpante li lukin e lipu pi tenpo sike, li luka e poka sijelo pi soweli Waloje. tenpo ni li tenpo pona ala tawa awen ko tan soweli. jan li pilin ike lon moku ona. sona kin la, waso li kama lukin e soweli ni."
,"He looked at the small remains of a flitch, and then looked undecidedly at Pigling. ""You may sleep on the rug,"" said Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson.",,"ona li lukin e ko soweli pi lili taso lon moku awen ona. ona li lukin e soweli Waloje, li sona ala e pona lon tenpo kama. jan Lanpante li toki: ""sina ken lape lon len ma."""
,"Pigling Bland slept like a top. In the morning Mr. Piperson made more porridge; the weather was warmer. He looked how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied—""You'll likely be moving on again?"" said he to Pigling Bland.",,"soweli Waloje li lape pona a. open pi tenpo suno la, jan Lanpante li pali e pan ko sin. lete pi tenpo suno pini la, seli li kama lon tenpo ni. jan li lukin e moku awen lon poki pi awen moku, li pilin pona ala tan mute lili moku—ona li toki tawa soweli Waloje: ""ken la, sina kama tawa sin, anu seme?"""
,"Before Pigling could reply, a neighbor, who was giving Mr. Piperson and the hens a lift, whistled from the gate. Mr. Piperson hurried out with the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or ""I'll come back and skin ye!"" said Mr. Piperson.",,"taso soweli li wile open e toki la, uta pi jan lama li mu e kon. jan ni li jan pi tomo poka, li ken e tawa lon jan Lanpante pi jo waso. jan Lanpante li tawa wawa, li jo e poki waso, li lawa e ni tawa soweli: ""o pini e lupa lon monsi mi. o luka e ala lon tomo. sina luka e ijo la, mi weka pakala e selo sina lon kama mi!"""
," It crossed Pigling's mind that if he had asked for a lift, too, he might still have been in time for market.",,"soweli Waloje li pilin e ni: ona li toki kin e wile tawa la, ona li ken tawa esun lon tenpo pona."
,"But he distrusted Peter Thomas.",,"taso jan Lanpante li nasa ike tawa ona."
,"After finishing breakfast at his leisure, Pigling had a look round the cottage; everything was locked up. He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen. Pigling ate the peel, and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket. He sang while he worked—",,"ona li pini e moku lon tenpo pi wile ona la, soweli Waloje li lukin e ale tomo; lupa ale li pini awen. ona li kama lukin e selo pi kili pan ma lon monsi pi tomo moku. ona li moku e selo kili. ona li telo e kiwen supa moku lon poki telo suli. ona li pali la, ona li kalama e musi—"
,"Tom with his pipe made such a noise, He called up all the girls and boys— And they all ran to hear him play, Over the hills and far away!—",,"""jan Lanpan li kalama kepeken ilo a, ona li kalama tawa a jan ale—jan ale li tawa ni, li wile kute a e musi ona wan!—"""
,"Suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in—",,"sin la, kalama uta wan li kalama kin—"
,"Over the hills and a great way off, The wind shall blow my top knot off!",,"""musi kalama suli! musi akalama suwi!"""
,"Pigling Bland put down a plate which he was wiping, and listened.",,"soweli Waloje li anpa e kiwen supa pi pali ona, li kute."
," After a long pause, Pigling went on tip-toe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen; there was nobody there.",,"tenpo kute li tenpo pi kalama ala la, soweli Waloje li tawa kepeken kalama ala, li lukin lon lupa sinpin pi tomo moku; jan ala li lon."
," After another pause, Pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard, and snuffed at the key-hole. It was quite quiet.",,"tenpo li awen tenpo pi kalama ala la, soweli Waloje li tawa lupa pi pini awen lon supa poki, li pilin e kon lon ilo awen kepeken nena. kalama ala li lon."
,"After another long pause, Pigling pushed a peppermint under the door. It was sucked in immediately.",,"tenpo kin li awen tenpo pi kalama ala la, soweli Waloje li pana e suwi namako wan tawa anpa lupa. suwi li kama tawa weka jo lon insa lupa lon tenpo sama."
,"In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all his remaining six peppermints.",,"awen pi tenpo suno ni la, soweli Waloje li pana wan e suwi luka wan pi jo ona."
,"When Mr. Piperson returned, he found Pigling sitting before the fire; he had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil; the meal was not get-at-able.",,"jan Lanpante li kama sin la, ona li kama lukin e soweli Waloje lon poka seli. soweli li kama weka e jaki lon poki seli, li pana e poki moku seli lon sewi; taso soweli li ken ala jo e moku la, moku li lon ala poki."
,"Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest. He did lock the cupboard door; but without properly shutting it. He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock.",,"jan Lanpante li pilin pona; ona li luka pona e monsi soweli, li pali e pan ko mute. ona li awen ala sona la, ona li pini ala e poki pi awen moku. ona li pini awen a e lupa lon poka pi supa poki; taso ona li pini pona ala e lupa ni la, lupa li awen ken open. ona li tawa lape lon lili pi tenpo pimeja la, ona li lawa e ni tawa soweli Waloje: ""insa pi tenpo suno kama li pini ala la, o kama ala tawa mi."""
," Pigling Bland sat by the fire, eating his supper.",,"soweli Waloje li awen lon poka seli, li moku e pan ko."
,"All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke—""My name is Pig-wig. Make me more porridge, please!"" Pigling Bland jumped and looked round.",,"tenpo ni la, kalama lili li kama lon poka pi luka ona—""mi soweli Pimejale. o pali e pan ko sin a!"" soweli Waloje li kama sewi wawa, li lukin lon ale."
," A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him. She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short turned up nose.",,"soweli pimeja li lon poka ona, li sama ona, li pona tawa lukin. pilin pona li lon sinpin ona. ona li jo e lukin lili tu pi suno mun e anpa lawa pi sike tu e nena lili pi sinpin lukin."
,"She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest—""How did you come here?"" asked Pigling Bland.",,"luka ona li nasin e lukin tawa kiwen supa moku; soweli Waloje li pana e moku ni kepeken tenpo lili, li tawa poki moku kepeken wawa—soweli Waloje li wile sona: ""sina kama lon ni lon nasin seme?"""
,"Stolen, replied Pig-wig, with her mouth full. Pigling helped himself to meal without scruple. ""What for?"" ""Bacon, hams,"" replied Pig-wig cheerfully. ""Why on earth don't you run away?"" exclaimed the horrified Pigling.",,"soweli Pimejale li moku la, ona li toki moku: ""jan li jo ike e mi kepeken nasin lawa ala."" soweli Waloje li kama jo e moku kin.

," ""I shall after supper,"" said Pig-wig decidedly.",,"soweli Pimejale li toki wawa: ""pini moku la, mi o tawa."""
,"Pigling Bland made more porridge and watched her shyly.",,"soweli Waloje li pali e pan ko sin, li lukin e soweli Pimejale, taso pilin lili ona la ona li lukin e soweli Pimejale tan poka taso."
,"She finished a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as though she were going to start.",,"soweli Pimejale li pini moku e moku ona nanpa tu la, ona li lukin lon ale. lukin ni li sama wile tawa."
,"You can't go in the dark, said Pigling Bland.",,"soweli Waloje li toki: ""sina ken ala tawa lon pimeja pi tenpo ni."""
,"Pig-wig looked anxious.",,"lukin la, soweli Pimeja li pilin ike tan sona ala."
,"Do you know your way by daylight?",,"""sina sona ala sona e nasin lon tenpo suno?"""
,"I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river. Which way are you going, Mr. Pig?",,"""mi sona e ni: mi ken lukin e tomo walo ni tan nena suli lon poka ante pi telo linja. sina tawa seme, soweli Waloje o?"""
,"To market—I have two pig papers. I might take you to the bridge; if you have no objection, said Pigling much confused, and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool. Pig-wig's gratitude was such, and she asked so many questions, that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.",,"soweli Waloje li toki: ""mi tawa esun—mi jo e lipu tu pi soweli tu. sina wile la, mi tu li ken tawa nasin kiwen pi sewi telo"" ona li awen lon selo pi supa monsi, li kama nasa lili e lawa ona. soweli Pimejale li kama pilin pona tan toki ona, li wile sona e mute la, ni li nasa lili e pilin ona."
,"He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep. Pig-wig then became quiet, and there was a smell of peppermint.",,"ona li kama wile sama lape tawa lukin, li pini e lukin sama lape. ni la, soweli Pimejale li kama kalama ala. kon suwi li lon tan suwi namako."
,"I thought you had eaten them? said Pigling, waking suddenly.",,"soweli Waloje li kama lape ala lon tenpo wawa. ""a, pilin mi la, sina moku e suwi ale lon tenpo pini, anu seme?"""
,"Only the corners, replied Pig-wig, studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight.",,"soweli Pimejale li pana e toki: ""selo lili taso."" ona li lukin e suwi kiwen lili ni lon suno sewi."
,"I wish you wouldn't; he might smell them through the ceiling, said the alarmed Pigling.",,"pilin pi soweli Waloje li kama pilin. ""a pilin mi la, o ni ala. jan li ken kama pilin e kon suwi lon nena ona."""
,"Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; ""Sing something,” she demanded.",,"soweli Pimejale li insa e suwi ko ni lon len poki ona; ona li wile: ""o kalama e musi."""
,"I am sorry . . . I have tooth-ache, said Pigling much dismayed.",,"ni la, soweli Waloje li pilin ike. ""ike mi. mi ken ala. kiwen uta mi li pilin pakala."""
," ""Then I will sing,"" replied Pig-wig, ""You will not mind if I say iddy tidditty? I have forgotten some of the words.""",,"soweli Pimejali li toki: ""ni la, mi kalama. taso mi sona ala e nimi ale la, mi kepeken nimi mu. ni li ike ala anu seme?"""
,"Pigling Bland made no objection; he sat with his eyes half shut, and watched her.",,"soweli Waloje la, ni li ike ala; ona li awen lon supa, li pini lili e lukin, li lukin e soweli."
," She wagged her head and rocked about, clapping time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice—",,"soweli Pimejale li tawa e lawa, li tawa sama musi, li kalama e luka lon sama, li kalama kepeken mu suwi soweli—"
,"A funny old mother pig lived in a stye, and three little piggies had she; (Ti idditty idditty) umph, umph, umph! and the little pigs said wee, wee!""",,"""soweli mama musi, li lon tomo ona, li jo e soweli tu wan; toki ona la mu mu; mu mu mu mu mu mu! soweli lili mu, mu, mu!"""
,"She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower and her little twinkly eyes closed up—",,"ona li kama kalama sona e nimi ale lon kalama kama tu tu, taso pini ale pi kalama wan la, lawa ona li kama anpa lili. sama la, lukin lili ona li kama pini lili lon pini kalama ale—"
,"Those three little piggies grew peaky and lean, and lean they might very well be; For somehow they couldn't say umph, umph, umph! and they wouldn't say wee, wee, wee! ""For somehow they couldn't say—""",,"soweli lili tu wan, li kama suli pona, li pini e mu ale. ona li ala e mu, la toki li open—"""
,"Pig-wig's head bobbed lower and lower, until she rolled over, a little round ball, fast asleep on the hearth-rug.",,"lawa pi soweli Pimejale li kama anpa mute la, ona li kama lape e sijelo ona, li sike e sijelo, li lape lon len ma."
,"Pigling Bland, on tip-toe, covered her up with an antimacassar.",,"soweli Waloje li kama tawa ona kepeken kalama ala, li pana e len awen lon sewi ona."
," He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the remainder of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr. Piperson overhead.",,"jan li ken kama la, soweli Waloje li wile ala lape, li awen kute e mu lili pipi, e mu lape suli jan."
," Early in the morning, between dark and daylight, Pigling tied up his little bundle and woke up Pig-wig. She was excited and half-frightened. ""But it's dark! How can we find our way?""",,"tenpo pimeja li kama suno lili, li kama ala tenpo suno la, soweli Waloje li pini awen e poki len ona, li kama pini e lape pi soweli Pimejale. ona li pilin pona tan ken kama, li pilin ike lili kin tan ken kama.

,"The cock has crowed; we must start before the hens come out; they might shout to Mr. Piperson.",,"""waso mije li kama mu e open pi tenpo suno; waso ale li ken weka tan tomo lon tenpo lili la, ona li ken mu e tawa mi tawa jan Lanpante. mi o tawa lon tenpo pi ni ala."""
,"Pig-wig sat down again, and commenced to cry.",,"soweli Pimejale li kama anpa sin, li pana e telo tan lukin."
,"Come away, Pig-wig; we can see when we get used to it. Come! I can hear them clucking!",,"""o kama, soweli Pimejale o; lukin mi li awen lon pimeja la, ona li kama lukin lon pimeja. o kama a! mi ken kute e mu waso!"""
,"Pigling had never said shuh! to a hen in his life, being peaceable; also he remembered the hamper.",,"tenpo ala la, soweli Waloje li mu ike e waso tawa weka waso tan nasin pona ona; kin la, ona li kama sona sin e poki waso."
," He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them. There was no garden; the neighborhood of Mr. Piperson's was all scratched up by fowls. They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.",,"ona li open e lupa tomo, li pini e lupa lon monsi pi tawa ona. ma ni li ma pi kili ala; ma ale pi poka tomo li kama lupa tan noka waso. soweli tu li luka e luka, li tawa lon ma pi noka waso, li tawa nasin."
,"The sun rose while they were crossing the moor, a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills. The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards.",,"ona li tawa lon ma ko telo la, suno li kama sewi, li suno wawa musi e sewi nena. suno li kama tawa anpa nena, li kama tawa noka nena, li kama lon ma tomo pi noka nena lon tomo walo lon ma kili lon ma pi kasi suwi."
," ""That's Westmorland,"" said Pig-wig. She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing—",,"soweli Pimejale li toki: ""ni li ma tomo Pokamako."" ona li pini e jo lon luka pi soweli Waloje, li open e tawa musi, li open e kalama musi—"
,"Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran! But all the tune that he could play, was 'Over the hills and far away!'""",,"""jan Lanpan li tawa. mama ona li kalama e musi mute. ona li jo ike e soweli lon nasin lawa ala, li tawa, li tawa! taso ona li sona kalama e musi wan taso"""
,"Come, Pig-wig, we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring. ""Why do you want to go to market, Pigling?"" inquired Pig-wig presently. ""I don't want; I want to grow potatoes."" ""Have a peppermint?"" said Pig-wig. Pigling Bland refused quite crossly. ""Does your poor toothy hurt?"" inquired Pig-wig. Pigling Bland grunted.",,"""o kama, soweli Pimejalo o, jan li ken kama la, mi o tawa nasin pi sewi telo."" soweli Pimejale li kama wi sona: ""sina wile tawa esun tan seme, soweli Waloje o?""

," Pig-wig ate the peppermint herself and followed the opposite side of the road. ""Pig-wig! keep under the wall, there's a man ploughing."" Pig-wig crossed over; they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.",,"ona taso la, soweli Pimejale li moku e suwi, li tawa lon poka nasin ante pi soweli Waloje. ""soweli Pimejale, o kama lon noka pi sinpin ni. jan li pali lon ma."" soweli Pimejale li kama lon poka sama pi soweli Waloje; ona tu li tawa selo ma kepeken wawa."
," Suddenly Pigling stopped; he heard wheels.",,"sin kama la, soweli Waloje li pini e tawa; ona li kute e kama pi sike tawa."
,"Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman's cart. The reins flapped on the horse's back; the grocer was reading a newspaper.",,"tomo tawa pi jan esun li kama lon nasin lon monsi ona. linja nasin li kalama lon sewi pi soweli tawa; jan esun li lukin e lipu."
,"Take that peppermint out of your mouth, Pig-wig, we may have to run. Don't say one word. Leave it to me. And in sight of the bridge! said poor Pigling, nearly crying. He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig's arm.",,"soweli Waloje li pilin ike, li toki pi pilin ni: ""soweli Pimejale, o weka e suwi tan uta sina. ken la mi wile tawa wawa. o toki ala. mi o toki. sina o lon poka nasin lon lukin!"" ona li kama tawa pi wawa ala, li luka jo e luka pi soweli Pimejale."
," The grocer, intent upon his newspaper, might have passed them if his horse had not shied and snorted. He pulled the cart crossways and held down his whip. ""Hallo? Where are you going to?""—Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly.",,"jan esun li lukin e lipu ona la, ona li ken tawa poka soweli, li ken tawa weka soweli lon lukin soweli ala, taso nena pi soweli tawa li kama nasa, li pana wawa e kon la, soweli tawa li nasa e tawa, li kama e lukin jan. jan esun li pini awen e nasin kepeken suli pi tomo tawa, li awen jo e ilo utala pi tawa soweli.

,"I thought as much. It was yesterday. Show me your licence?",,"""a, tenpo lili la, mi pilin e ni. esun li lon tenpo suno pini. o pana e lipu lawa tawa lukin mi."""
,"Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer's horse, which had picked up a stone.",,
,"The grocer flicked his whip—""Papers? Pig licence?"" Pigling fumbled in all his pockets, and handed up the papers. The grocer read them, but still seemed dissatisfied. ""This here pig is a young lady; is her name Alexander?"" Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.",,
," The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper—""Lost, stolen or strayed, ten shillings reward""; he looked suspiciously at Pig-wig. Then he stood up in the trap, and whistled to the ploughman.",,
,"You wait here while I drive on and speak to him, said the grocer, gathering up the reins. He knew that pigs are slippery; but surely, such a very lame pig could never run!",,
," ""Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back."" The grocer did so; he saw the two pigs standing stock-still in the middle of the road. Then he looked over at his horse's heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out after he got to the ploughman.",,
,"Now, Pig-wig, NOW! said Pigling Bland.",,
,"Never did pigs run as these pigs ran! They raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge. Little fat Pig-wig's petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she bounded and jumped.",,
," They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes.",,
,"They came to the river, they came to the bridge—they crossed it hand in hand—",,
," then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!",,
