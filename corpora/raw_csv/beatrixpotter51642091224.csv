,"ONCE upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl—only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!",,"tenpo pini wan la, jan lili li lon. nimi ona li jan Lusi. ona li lon tomo Lilima lon ma. ona li jan pona—a, taso ona li awen weka e len pona ona pi weka jaki!"
,"One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying—oh, she did cry so! ""I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have you seen them, Tabby Kitten?""",,"tenpo suno wan la, jan lili Lusi li kama lon ma lon poka tomo, li mu ike pi pilin ike—a mu ike ona li mute. ""mi weka e len pona mi! ni li kama len weka tu wan a! soweli Lenlinja o, sina lukin ala lukin e len mi?"""
,"THE Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen—",,"soweli li awen uta e noka walo ona; ni la, jan Lusi li toki tawa waso tomo—"
,"Sally Henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins?",,"waso Meliweli o, sina lukin ala lukin e len mi tu wan?"
,"But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking—",,"taso waso li tawa tomo lili, li mu—"
,"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!",,"mi tawa kepeken len noka ala, kepeken len noka ala, kepeken len noka ala!"
,"AND then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.",,"ni la, jan Lusi li toki tawa waso Lojekin. ona li lon kasi."
,"Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.",,"waso Lojekin li poka e lawa ona, li lukin e jan Lusi kepeken lukin pimeja suno ona. ona li tawa kon lon sewi pi palisa sinpin, li tawa weka."
,"Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town—a hill that goes up—up—into the clouds as though it had no top!",,"jan Lusi li tawa lon palisa sinpin, li lukin e nena lon monsi pi tomo Lilima—nena li sewi, li sewi, li sewi tawa walo ko kon sewi!"
,"And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.",,"ona li tawa lon nena, li kama sewi la, ona li pilin e ni; ona li kama lukin e ijo walo lon ma pi laso kasi."
,"LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way—up and up—until Little-town was right away down below—she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!",,"jan Lusi li tawa wawa lon nena, li tawa tan wawa ale pi noka ona; ona li tawa lon nasin pi sewi wawa, li tawa sewi, li tawa sewi la, tomo Lilima li kama lon anpa ona. ona li wile la, ona li ken pana e kiwen tawa lupa pi sewi tomo!"
,"PRESENTLY she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside.",,"tenpo ni la, ona li kama lon open telo."
,"Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water—but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet—there were footmarks of a very small person.",,"jan li pana e poki lon kiwen la, poki li ken poki e telo—taso telo mute mute li kama la, telo li ken ala awen lon insa tan ni: poki li lili mute a! poka ona la, ma li kama telo—lupa lili li lon ma tan noka jan pi lili mute."
,"Lucie ran on, and on.",,"jan Lusi li tawa, li tawa, li awen tawa."
,"THE path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes-pins—but no pocket-handkerchiefs!",,"nasin li kama pini lon anpa pi kiwen suli. ma ni la, kasi lili li lili pona, li laso. linja kasi awen li lon, li ilo, li ken e awen len. palisa awen lili ilo kin li lon, li ken e awen len. taso len ala li lon tenpo ni!"
,"But there was something else—a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing—",,"a taso ijo ante li lon—lupa li lon! insa ona li tawa insa nena; insa ona la, kalama li kama, li musi—"
,"Lily-white and clean, oh! With little frills between, oh! ⁠Smooth and hot—red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!",,"walo pona li jaki ala a! namako lili pona li lon ona a! li kama supa, li kama seli—jaki loje lili ni li lon ala a!"
,"LUCIE knocked—once—twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out ""Who's that?""",,"jan Lusi li luka kalama e lupa lon tenpo wan—lon tenpo tu—li pini e musi kalama. kalama lili li kama, li lili tan pilin anpa, li wile sona: ""seme li lon?"""
,"Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?—a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams—just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.",,"jan Lusi li open e lupa. pilin sina la, seme li lon insa nena?—tomo moku pona li lon. anpa li supa pona. sewi li awen pona tan palisa awen. ni li sama tomo moku ante ale. a, taso sewi li sewi mute ala la, lawa pi jan Lusi li ken kama selo lili e ona; kin la, poki moku ale li lili. ijo ante kin li lili."
,"THERE was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.",,"jan Lusi li ken pilin e kon pi moku seli kepeken nena ona; supa moku la, meli lili sike li lon, li jo e ilo seli pi pona len, li lukin e jan Lusi. meli li pilin ike lili tan sona ala, li sona ala e kama."
,"Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap—where Lucie had yellow curls—that little person had Prickles!",,"len ona li awen sewi tan pali. len awen pali li awen e len kule pona ona. nena pimeja ona li pilin e kon, li pilin, li pilin. lukin ona li suno suwi sama mun lili; jan Lusi li jo e linja jelo lon lawa, taso anpa pi len lawa la meli li jo e linja jelo ala e palisa lili mute a!"
,"WHO are you? said Lucie. ""Have you seen my pocket-handkins?""",,"jan Lusi li wile sona: ""sina jan seme? sina lukin ala lukin e len mi pi weka jaki?"""
,"The little person made a bob-curtsey—""Oh yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!"" And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.",,"meli li tawa anpa lili pona lon toki—""a, pona sina la, mi meli Kiki; a, pona sina la, mi weka pona e jaki tan len!"" "
,"WHAT'S that thing? said Lucie—""that's not my pocket-handkin?""",,"jan Lusi li toki: ""ni li seme? a, ni li len mi ala, anu seme."""
,"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!",,"""a, ala. a, pona sina la, ni li len sijelo loje tan waso Lojekin!"""
,"And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.",,"ona li supa pona e len ni kepeken ilo seli, li pana e ni lon poka."
,"THEN she took something else off a clothes-horse—""That isn't my pinny!"" said Lucie.",,"ante la, ona li kama e len ante tan palisa—jan Lusi li toki: ""ni kin li len mi ala!"""
,"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash! said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.",,"meli Kiki li toki: ""a, ala. a, pona sina la, ni li len pi supa moku tan waso Suwili. o lukin e jaki loje tan telo kili loje! mi wile weka e jaki ni la ken ni li pona ala!"""
,"MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE'S nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.",,"nena pimeja ona li pilin e kon, li pilin, li pilin. lukin ona li suno suwi sama mun lili. ona li kama e ilo seli len ante tan seli suno."
,"THERE'S one of my pocket-handkins! cried Lucie—""and there's my pinny!""",,"jan Lusi li kalama: ""a! ni a li len wan mi!"""
,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.",,"meli Kiki li supa e len kepeken ilo seli, li pona e selo len, li kon pona tawa e namako len."
,"Oh that is lovely! said Lucie.",,"jan Lusi li toki: ""aa ni li pona suwi!"
,"AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?",,"ijo jelo suli ni li seme? pini ona li sama len luka."""
,"Oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny—look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon go barefoot! said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.",,"meli Kiki li toki: ""a, ni li len noka suwi tan waso Meliweli—o lukin e ni: ona li noka mute e ma la, lupa li kama lon len. ni li awen la, noka ona li kama lon ma kepeken len ala a!"""
,"WHY, there's another hankersniff—but it isn't mine; it's red?",,"a, ni li len sama len mi—taso ona li len mi ala; ona li loje?"
,"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the smell.",,"a, len sina ala. a, pona sina la, ni li len tan soweli mama pi kute suli. pilin nena la, kon kili li awen lon ona! mi telo e ona lon ala poka pi len ante, taso kon li awen"
,"There's another one of mine, said Lucie.",,"jan Lusi li toki: ""a, mi kama lukin sin e len ante mi."
,"WHAT are those funny little white things?",,"ijo walo musi ni li seme?"""
,"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.",,"len luka ni li tan soweli Lenlinja; mi supa seli taso e len ni; soweli a li telo e len ona."
,"There's my last pocket-handkin! said Lucie.",,"jan Lusi li toki: ""ni li len pini mi!"""
,"AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?",,"a, sina pana e seme lon poki lon telo pi weka jaki?"
,"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse—most terrible particular! said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. ""Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.""",,"meli Kiki li toki: ""ni li len suwi pi sijelo sinpin tan waso Sowelili—jaki mute li lon a."" ona li awen toki: ""mi pini e pali supa lon len ale. ni la, mi kama kon pona e len."""
,"WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things? said Lucie.",,"jan Lusi li toki: ""ijo ko pona ni li seme"""
,"Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.",,"a, ni li len suli tan soweli len lili lon ma Nenakiwen."
,"Will their jackets take off? asked Lucie.",,"jan Lusi li wile sona: ""a, len ona li ken ala ken kama weka tan ona?"""
,"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They're always marked at washing! said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.",,"meli Kiki li toki: ""a, ken! a, pona sina la, o lukin e sitelen soweli lon sewi len. sitelen ni la, soweli wan li kama tan ma Lupama. sitelen ni la, soweli tu wan li kama tan tomo Lilima. mi telo e len la, sitelen li lon len ale ni."""
,"AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes—small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing—and at last the basket was empty!",,
,"THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea—a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.",,
,"WHEN they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.",,
,"And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.",,
,"THEN away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!",,
,"All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!",,
,"AND she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.",,
,"SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.",,
,"LUCIE scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say ""Good-night,"" and to thank the washer-woman.—But what a very odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!",,
,"She was running, running, running up the hill—and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown—and her petticoat?",,
,"AND how small she had grown—and how brown—and covered with prickles!",,"a, ona li lili tawa lukin—a kule ona li sama ma—a, sijelo ale ona la, palisa lili li lon!"
,"Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a Hedgehog!",,"a! meli Kiki li soweli kin pi palisa lili mute!"
,"*⁠*⁠*⁠*⁠*⁠* (Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile—but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?",,
,"And besides—I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells—and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)",,
