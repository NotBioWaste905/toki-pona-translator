,"ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were—",,"tenpo wan la, soweli lili tu tu pi kute suli li lon. ona li—"
,"Flopsy, ⁠Mopsy, ⁠Cotton-tail, and Peter.",,"soweli Lawako, li soweli Sikeko, li soweli Monsiko, li soweli Pita."
,"'NOW, my dears,' said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, 'you may go into the ﬁelds or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.'",,"tenpo suno open wan la, mama ona li toki e ni: ""suwi mi o, sina ken tawa ma pan. sina ken tawa nasin. taso o tawa ala ma kili pi jan Mekeke. mama mije sina li kama pakala lon ma ni. jan meli Mekeke li insa e ona lon pan."""
,"'NOW run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.'",,"""o tawa. o ike ala. mi tawa weka."""
,"THEN old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.",,"soweli mama li poka e poki, e ilo selo pi telo weka. ona li tawa ma kasi, li tawa tomo pan. ona li esun e pan suli, e pan suli tu tu wan pi kili lili."
,"FLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries:",,"soweli Lawako en soweli Sikeko en soweli Monsiko li soweli lili pona. ona li tawa nasin, li poki e kili pimeja."
,"BUT Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!",,"taso soweli Pita li pona ala. kepeken tenpo ala la, ona li tawa ma kasi pi jan Mekeke. lupa pi ma kasi li pini la, ona li tawa anpa lupa, li tawa insa ma!"
,"FIRST he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;",,"open la, ona li moku e kili lipu laso, e kili pi palisa laso lili. ante la, ona li moku e kili loje pi anpa ma."
,"AND then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.",,"ni la, ona li pilin jaki. ona li wile alasa e kasi namako."
,"BUT round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!",,"taso ona li kama lon sinpin pi kili palisa laso la, seme li lon? jan mije Mekeke a!"
,"MR. McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, 'Stop thief!'",,"jan Mekeke li anpa lon luka ona, li ma e kili sin. taso ona li tawa sewi, li tawa soweli Pita, li tawa e ilo ma lon luka, li kalama e ni: ""o pini, soweli ike pi kili mi o!"""
,"PETER was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.",,"soweli Pita li pilin wawa ike a. ona li sona ala e nasin weka la, ona li tawa lon ale pi ma kasi."
,"He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.",,"len noka ona wan li kama weka lon kili lipu. len noka ona ante li kama weka lon kili pan."
,"AFTER losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.",,"ni la, ona li tawa kepeken luka, kepeken noka. tawa ni li tawa wawa la, ona li ken weka - taso ona li tawa insa pi len kili. kiwen awen li lon len laso sijelo pi soweli Pita la, len li awen e kiwen jelo suno ni, li pini e weka pi soweli Pita."
,"PETER gave himself up for lost, and cried big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.",,"soweli Pita li pilin ike tan moli kama, li pana e telo mute tan oko; taso waso li kute e kalama ona pi pilin ike. waso li tawa ona, li wile e pona tawa ona, li wile e tawa weka wawa tan ona."
,"MR. McGREGOR came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.",,"jan mije Mekeke li kama, li jo e ilo poki len, li wile poki e soweli Pita kepeken ilo. taso soweli Pita li kama tawa, li kama weka lon tenpo sama. len laso ona li awen lon ma."
,"AND rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.",,"ona li tawa tomo lili ilo, li tawa insa pi poki kiwen. telo ala li lon poki ni la, poki ni li pona, taso telo li lon."
,"MR. McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a ﬂower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.",,"jan Mekeke li pilin wawa e ni: soweli Pita li lon tomo ilo. ken la, ona li lon poki kasi. jan li tawa e poki ale, li lukin e ale."
,"Presently Peter sneezed—'Kertyschoo!' Mr. McGregor was after him in no time.",,"tenpo ni la, soweli Pita li weka wawa e kon tan uta a—""mu!"" jan Mekeke li tawa ona kepeken wawa"
,"AND tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.",,"li wile noka e soweli Pita. soweli Pita li tawa luka lukin, li pakala e kasi tu wan. lupa lukin li lili tawa jan la, jan Mekeke li ken ala tawa ona. kin la, wawa ona li kama lili tan alasa soweli. ona li kama sin tawa pali ona."
,"PETER sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.",,"soweli Pita li anpa e monsi tawa lape lili. wawa pi kon ona li lili. sijelo ona li tawa mute tan pilin ike. ona li sona ala e nasin pona. kin la, ona li telo tan telo pi insa poki."
,"After a time he began to wander about, going lippity—lippity—not very fast, and looking all round.",,"tenpo li tawa la, ona li open sin e tawa, li tawa lili, li tawa lili, li kepeken ala wawa, li lukin."
,"HE found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.",,"lukin la, lupa li lon sinpin; taso ona li pini. soweli sama soweli Pita la, lupa lili li lon ala."
,"An old mouse was running in and out over the stone door-step, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.",,
,"THEN he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.",,
,"HE went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe—scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!",,
,"PETER got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.",,
,"Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.",,
,"MR. McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.",,
,"PETER never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.",,"soweli Pita li pini ala e tawa, li lukin ala tawa monsi. ona li kama lon tomo ona lon kasi kiwen suli la, ona li pini taso e tawa."
,"He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!",,
,"I AM sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.",,"ike la, soweli Pita li pilin pona ala lon pini pi tenpo suno."
,"His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!",,"mama ona li lape e ona lon supa lape, li pali e telo kasi. mama li pana e wan telo tawa soweli Pita!"
,"'One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'",,"""o moku e ona kepeken wan pi ilo moku lon tenpo lape."""
,"BUT Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.",,"taso soweli Lawako en soweli Sikeko en soweli Monsiko li ken moku e pan e telo walo e kili pimeja lon pini pi tenpo suno."
